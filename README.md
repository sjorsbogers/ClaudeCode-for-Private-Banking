# Claude Code for Private Banking (v2)

An interactive course that teaches non-technical private banking professionals to use Claude Code through narrative-driven exercises set at a fictional wealth management firm.

## What's New in v2

- **Module 1 expanded** from 9 to 20 lessons — practical daily-use skills are now the course centrepiece
- **6 role-specific deep-dives** — RM, Analyst, Marketing, Manager, Operations, Compliance
- **4 advanced technique lessons** — regulatory awareness, prompt engineering, integrations, verification
- **Reality Check sidebars** in all build lessons — bridges mock data to production requirements
- **Companion website** — pre-IDE setup guide so students don't need Claude Code to install Claude Code
- **Merged "Ship It" lessons** — GitHub + Deploy combined from Module 3 onward
- **Capstone module** — portfolio review, workflow design, next steps
- **7 new chaos files** — DDQ, correspondence, operations manual, board deck, marketing, regulatory bulletin
- **Dynamic compliance checkpoints** — Raj's reviews adapt to what was actually built
- **102 slash commands** — two per lesson (numbered + branded)
