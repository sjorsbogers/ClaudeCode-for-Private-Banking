# Competitor Research: Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management

*Research compiled by: Thomas Reiter, July 2025*
*Status: Incomplete — started during Q2, got pulled into other priorities*

---

## Overview
- AUM: $1+ trillion in PWM
- Minimum: $10M (same as us)
- Global presence: 30+ offices worldwide
- Client-to-advisor ratio: approximately 25:1

## Digital Capabilities (This Is Where They Kill Us)

### Marcus Goldman Platform (Client Portal)
- Real-time portfolio view accessible 24/7
- Mobile app with push notifications for significant market events
- Custom reporting — clients can generate their own reports anytime
- Interactive performance attribution
- Document vault (all reports, tax docs, legal docs in one place)
- Secure messaging with advisory team
- Note: client #CC-0089 specifically mentioned this platform when reducing their allocation with us

### Reporting
- Automated quarterly reports generated within 3 business days of quarter end
- Reports include interactive elements (click to drill down into asset classes)
- Available as PDF and web-based
- Personalized commentary (unclear if AI-assisted or human-written)
- Multi-currency, multi-entity consolidated views
- Tax-optimized reporting by jurisdiction

### Onboarding
- Digital onboarding process — estimated 5-7 business days
- KYC document upload via secure portal
- Digital identity verification
- Electronic signatures throughout
- Estimated they handle 3-4x our volume with a similar-sized ops team

## Weaknesses
- Impersonal at scale — clients complain about feeling like a number
- High RM turnover — relationships break frequently
- Bureaucratic — getting custom anything is slow
- Fee structure is complex and not always transparent
- They have size but we have agility (or we should)
- Investment performance: good but not exceptional. We consistently outperform by 2-3% annually

## What We Can Learn
1. **Automated reporting is table stakes** at this level. We're behind.
2. Client portal is expected, not a luxury
3. Their digital onboarding is years ahead of our paper-based process
4. They invest heavily in technology — estimated $500M+ annually on wealth tech

## What We Can Beat Them On
1. Investment performance (our #1 advantage)
2. Personal relationships (when we deliver on them)
3. Agility — we can build and deploy faster than their bureaucracy allows
4. AI-native approach — they bolt AI onto legacy systems; we can build AI-first

## Threat Level: HIGH
They're actively poaching in our market. Two of our clients were approached in Q3.
