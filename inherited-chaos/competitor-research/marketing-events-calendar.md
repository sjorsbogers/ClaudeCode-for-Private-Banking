## REJECTED / DEFERRED IDEAS

### A. Sponsorship of Art Basel (Basel, June 2026)
**Proposed by:** Thomas (2025)
**Budget ask:** CHF 150,000 (partner-level sponsorship)
**Decision:** REJECTED by Marcus. Too expensive for our size. "We'd be a minnow next to UBS and Deutsche Bank. Better to do our own intimate art event." — Marcus, email 14 July 2025

### B. Crypto/Digital Assets Conference (Davos sidecar event, Jan 2026)
**Proposed by:** James Crawford
**Budget ask:** CHF 25,000
**Decision:** DEFERRED. Raj flagged regulatory concerns about being seen to promote digital assets before our internal policy is finalized. Marcus agreed. "Let's get our house in order first." Revisit H2 2026.

### C. Golf Tournament — Crans-Montana
**Proposed by:** Thomas
**Budget ask:** CHF 35,000
**Decision:** REJECTED. "Not aligned with brand. We're not a private bank from 1985." — Marcus. (Thomas was annoyed about this one.)

## COMPETITOR INTELLIGENCE — MARKETING & EVENTS

### UBS Global Wealth Management
- Platinum/headline sponsor at almost every major event. Budget is incomparable.
- Launched "UBS Next" digital platform for next-gen clients — sophisticated, app-based.
- Running AI-powered portfolio insights for HNW+ clients (announced Sept 2025). Clients are mentioning this to our RMs.
- Art collection programme (long-standing) — threat to our art event differentiation.

### Julius Baer
- Won "Best Private Bank in Switzerland" at PWM awards 2025. Using it heavily in marketing.
- "Young Leaders Programme" — multi-event series for next-gen. Very polished. We've lost at least one next-gen prospect to this.
- Strong Middle East presence — Dubai office very active. Could compete with us for Al-Rashid type families.
- Took our Gruber family. Intelligence suggests pricing was the lever.

### Lombard Odier
- Sustainability leaders in the Swiss market. Launched dedicated "Natural Capital" strategy.
- Philanthropy advisory as formal service line — several of our ESG-interested clients have mentioned them.
- Van der Berg received a direct approach (Friedrich mentioned to Elena, Jan 2026).
- Events focus on sustainability themes — attract a specific client profile.

### Pictet
- "Next Gen Academy" — week-long immersive programme at their HQ. Alumni network becoming a thing.
- Expanded Singapore office — hired 3 senior RMs from competitors in 2025.
- Strong institutional brand — "We've been private since 1805" positioning resonates.
- Won 3 Swiss families from smaller firms in 2025 (per market intelligence).

### DBS Private Bank (Singapore)
- Home court advantage in Singapore. Regulator relationships, local market knowledge.
- Launched "DBS digiPortfolio" — robo-advisory for lower tier, freeing RMs for UHNW.
- Aggressive on pricing for Asian families. We can't compete on fees — must compete on service.
- iWealth platform is best-in-class for mobile banking.
