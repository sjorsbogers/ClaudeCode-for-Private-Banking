# Competitor Research: UBS Global Family Office

*Research: Thomas R., August 2025*
*Incomplete*

---

## Quick Facts
- Largest wealth manager globally (~$3.5T in invested assets)
- Global Family Office division serves UHNW families >$50M
- Offices everywhere — we can't compete on geographic reach
- Strong in multi-generational wealth planning

## Strengths
- **Reporting platform**: UBS My Way — customizable dashboards, real-time portfolio views
  - Consolidates external assets (can show non-UBS holdings too)
  - Multi-entity, multi-currency consolidated views
  - One client told me it's "the best reporting they've ever seen"
- **Multi-jurisdiction expertise**: Tax, legal, regulatory across 50+ countries
  - Relevant for our clients with complex international structures (Al-Rashid, Chen)
- **Credit/lending**: Can provide Lombard loans, structured financing
  - We don't offer this. We refer to banks. That's a leakage point.
- **Succession planning**: Dedicated next-gen advisory team
  - Van der Berg family specifically asked about this
- **Scale**: They can throw resources at problems we can't

## Weaknesses
- **Investment performance**: Mediocre. Benchmark-hugging strategies. We outperform by 3-4% consistently.
- **Personal touch**: At their scale, relationships are transactional
  - One client who came FROM UBS said: "I was a number to them"
- **Fees**: Higher all-in cost than us for comparable service
- **Innovation speed**: Bureaucratic. Takes 12-18 months to roll out new services.
- **RM turnover**: Constant. Their best people leave to start boutiques (like Marcus did!)

## Their Recent Moves
- Launched "UBS Wealth Way" framework — goals-based wealth planning
- Investing heavily in AI for client service (internally called "Lighthouse" project, details unclear)
- Opened new Singapore office expansion — directly competes with our Singapore operation
- Hired 3 senior advisors in Zurich from Credit Suisse integration

## What We Should Worry About
1. Their reporting platform is leagues ahead of ours
2. If they match our investment performance (even partially), their platform advantage could tip clients
3. Al-Rashid Trust specifically mentioned UBS's multi-jurisdiction capabilities
4. Their Singapore expansion directly targets our APAC growth plans

## What We Should Steal (Legally)
- Consolidated multi-entity reporting view — our complex clients need this
- Goals-based framework — we focus too much on returns, not enough on life goals
- Next-gen engagement — we don't talk to our clients' children enough

## Threat Level: MEDIUM-HIGH
Big threat for complex, international clients. Less threatening for clients who value performance and personal relationships.
