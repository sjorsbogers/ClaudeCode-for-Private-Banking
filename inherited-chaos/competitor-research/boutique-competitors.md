# Boutique Competitor Notes

*Thomas R. — various dates, Q2-Q3 2025*
*These are our REAL competitors. The ones that actually win clients from us.*

## Alpine Wealth Partners

**WATCH THIS ONE. They just won a client from us.**

- Based in Zurich, founded 2019
- AUM: ~$2B (small but growing fast — 50% YoY)
- ~20 employees, 60 UHNW clients
- Minimum: $5M (lower than us)
- Led by former Julius Baer MD Claudia Weber

### What They Do Well
- **Client portal**: Built a custom client portal using modern tech stack. Real-time portfolio view, secure messaging, document vault. It works on mobile. It looks amazing.
- **Reporting**: Fully automated. Reports generated within 48 hours of quarter end. Professional design. Personalized commentary (they told us they use AI for draft commentary — client said "it reads like a human wrote it").
- **Onboarding**: Digital onboarding with electronic signatures. 5 business days or less. Client #CC-0199 specifically cited this when they left us.
- **Communication**: Monthly personalized insights email, not just quarterly reports. Proactive market commentary when relevant events happen.
- **Investment performance**: Good but not exceptional. +11% last year. We beat them by 3 points.

### What They Do Poorly
- Limited scale — can't handle complex multi-jurisdiction structures
- Small team — if 2-3 people leave, they're in trouble
- No alternatives/PE access — mostly public markets
- No credit/lending capability
- Track record still short (5 years)

### Why They're Dangerous
They're basically what we SHOULD be: a boutique with excellent technology. They're stealing the clients who value service experience over raw performance.

Client #CC-0199 exit interview: "Alpine showed us their client experience and we realized what we were missing."

### Threat Level: HIGH for service-sensitive clients

## Meridian Family Office

- Based in London and Geneva
- AUM: ~$4B
- ~35 employees, 90 clients
- Minimum: $15M
- Led by ex-Pictet team

### What They Do Well
- Strong in tax and estate planning — it's their niche
- Very good with multi-generational transfers
- High touch — max 20 clients per advisor (we're at 25-30)
- Good reputation in Middle Eastern and South Asian communities
- Solid compliance and regulatory track record

### What They Do Poorly
- Investment performance is average (+9% last year)
- No technology differentiation — they're as paper-based as we are
- Slow to adapt — conservative culture
- Expensive — their fees are 15-20% higher than ours

### Why They Matter
They compete for the same client profile in London and Geneva. Their tax planning expertise is better than ours. If a client prioritizes estate planning, Meridian wins.

### Threat Level: MEDIUM

## Lakeview Capital

- Based in Singapore, Hong Kong
- AUM: ~$1.5B
- ~15 employees, 40 clients
- Minimum: $20M
- Founded by ex-DBS/Citi team

### What They Do Well
- Deep APAC expertise — they know every nuance of the Singapore, Hong Kong, and increasingly Southeast Asian markets
- Strong China A-share access
- Excellent relationships with APAC fund managers
- Aggressive on alternatives — direct PE, venture, real estate
- Very fast response times — "they reply to emails within 2 hours" per our Singapore team

### What They Do Poorly
- No European presence
- Limited fixed income expertise
- Small team, key person risk
- Regulatory footprint only in Singapore and HK
- Reporting is basic (but fast)

### Why They Matter
They directly compete for our Singapore clients. Two of our clients have secondary relationships with Lakeview for APAC-specific allocations. Risk of full mandate transfer if they build more capability.

### Threat Level: MEDIUM for APAC-focused clients

Our biggest competitive gap is clear: technology and service speed. We have the best investment performance and good personal relationships, but our reporting, onboarding, and digital capabilities are at the bottom of the pack.

That's the gap to close.
