### EMAIL — From: Friedrich Van der Berg | To: Elena Vasquez
**Date:** 12 November 2025
**Subject: RE: RE: RE: Q3 Portfolio Report**

Elena,

I appreciate the follow-up but I must be direct — receiving our quarterly report six weeks after quarter-end is not acceptable for a family with our level of assets under management. When we were with Lombard Odier, reports arrived within 15 business days. Consistently.

I raised this in our April meeting and was told it would improve. It has not.

Separately, the consolidated view still shows the Liechtenstein structure separately from the Swiss holdings. I have asked three times for a single unified view. The report I received last week was 47 pages but I still cannot see our total net position on one page.

I remain committed to Claudius Capital but I expect this to be resolved before year-end.

Regards,
Friedrich

**1. Portfolio Performance Review**
- Overall portfolio +8.2% YTD (vs benchmark +6.7%)

**2. Succession Planning**
- David Loh presented updated structure: Singapore holding company with subsidiary trusts for each child

- ACTION: Marcus to introduce Wei to Claudius London team for Li-Na's UK-side planning

### EMAIL — From: Marcus Richter | To: All RMs
**Date:** 28 August 2025
**Subject: Client NPS Results — Please Read**

Team,

The Q2 NPS survey results are in and I won't sugarcoat it — we dropped from 62 to 54. For a firm of our calibre, this is concerning.

Top complaints:
1. Reporting timeliness (again)
2. Lack of proactive communication
3. Portal/technology gaps
4. Fee transparency

Top praise:
1. Investment performance
2. Relationship quality with primary RM
3. Event programme (especially the Zurich art evening)

I want each of you to review your client scores (Sarah will distribute individually) and come prepared to our Monday meeting with specific actions.

This is not optional.

Marcus

### PHONE NOTE — RM: Elena Vasquez
**Client: Morrison Family Trust**
**Date: 7 December 2025**

Lady Catherine Morrison called, quite upset. She received a fee statement showing CHF 45,000 in "advisory fees" for Q3 that she says were never discussed. I checked — it appears to be related to the structured product restructuring that Thomas coordinated before he left. Thomas apparently agreed to a reduced fee verbally but it was never documented in the system.

I've escalated to Sarah. Lady Catherine wants a call with Marcus directly. She mentioned (twice) that "Pictet would never let this happen."

URGENT: Need to resolve before Christmas. The Morrisons have CHF 180M with us and Lady Catherine chairs the board of the Zurich Opera Foundation — reputational risk if she's unhappy.

### EMAIL — From: Aisha Patel | To: Elena Vasquez
**Date:** 22 October 2025
**Subject: Introducing myself — new to family office**

Dear Elena,

My name is Aisha Patel and I've recently taken over management of the Patel Family Office based in London. My father Vikram has spoken very highly of Claudius Capital and your team.

We currently have approximately GBP 45M managed by three different firms and I'm looking to consolidate. Our priorities are:
1. Simplified reporting (one view across all holdings)
2. ESG-aligned investing — particularly interested in climate tech and social impact
3. Next-gen wealth education (I have two teenage children beginning to learn about the family's wealth)
4. Shariah-compliant options for a portion of the portfolio (roughly 30%)

Would you be available for an introductory call next week? I'm based in Mayfair but travel to Zurich regularly.

Best regards,
Aisha Patel

### HANDWRITTEN NOTE (scanned) — RM: Thomas (former ops manager)
**Date: undated (estimated June/July 2025)**

Spoke to Dietrich Hoffman at the Baur au Lac dinner. He's unhappy with his current setup at Vontobel. Has ~CHF 90M, mostly Swiss equities and real estate. Conservative investor, old school. Doesn't want ESG "shoved down his throat" (his words). Interested in a quiet conversation. I said I'd arrange lunch with Marcus.

NOTE TO SELF: Hoffman knows the Van der Berg family socially. Don't mention one to the other.

### EMAIL — From: James Crawford | To: Sarah Chen (COO)
**Date:** 5 January 2026
**Subject: Re: Updated fee schedule**

Sarah,

Just to confirm — have we communicated the new fee structure to all London clients yet? I have three meetings next week and don't want to be caught off-guard if clients have seen something I haven't.

Also, the Morrison situation still isn't resolved. Who's owning this now that Thomas is gone?

James

### MEETING NOTE — RM: Priya Anand
**Client: Al-Rashid Family**
**Date:** 30 November 2025
**Location: Video call (Singapore–Dubai)**

Brief catch-up with Fatima Al-Rashid (next-gen, Dubai-based). Key points:

- Family expanding real estate portfolio in Singapore — want Claudius to help with due diligence on two properties
- Fatima frustrated with speed of KYC renewal process ("we've been clients for 7 years, why do we need to re-prove everything?")
- Asked about sustainable sukuk options — I don't have strong knowledge here, need to connect with London team
- She mentioned a competitor (unnamed) approached her father with "AI-powered portfolio insights" — seemed impressed
- Fatima is 28, Oxford-educated, very tech-savvy. She will be the primary contact going forward.

ACTION: Research sustainable sukuk. Connect Fatima with James in London for Shariah-compliant products. Expedite KYC renewal (flag for compliance).

### PHONE NOTE — RM: Elena Vasquez
**Client: Van der Berg Family**
**Date: 16 January 2026**

Friedrich called — calmer than November email. Acknowledged improvement in Q4 reporting timeline (delivered in 4 weeks vs 6). Still wants consolidated single-page view. I promised Q1 report would include it.

He also mentioned estate planning — wants to discuss transferring art collection (estimated EUR 12M) into foundation structure. Needs to happen before Dutch tax changes in 2027. Wants a meeting with external counsel in Amsterdam.

Positive: said he's "not going anywhere" and values the relationship. But he did say Lombard Odier called him last week.
