## Verbatim Comments

**Positive (fewer this quarter):**
- "Despite my frustrations with the service, I acknowledge the investment returns remain among the best I've seen. +14.2% net for the year." — Client #CC-0012
- "The year-end review with Marcus was excellent as always. He remains the reason I'm here." — Client #CC-0034

**Constructive (growing louder):**
- "I don't need more data. I need someone to tell me what it means for my family." — Client #CC-0045
- "Your quarterly report is 12 pages long and tells me nothing I can't see on Bloomberg myself. Where's the insight? Where's the personalization?" — Client #CC-0091
- "We had a meeting last week. My RM clearly hadn't reviewed my portfolio beforehand. That's not acceptable at our AUM level." — Client #CC-0112
- "The report format changed AGAIN. Third different format in four quarters. Pick one and stick with it." — Client #CC-0023
- "I asked my RM for a quick portfolio update in November. Got it in December. That's not quick." — Client #CC-0167
- "Your proposal template looks like it was last updated in 2020. Our potential co-investor commented on how dated it looked." — Client #CC-0203
- "When I compare the level of service to what I'm paying, I'm increasingly questioning the value proposition. Returns alone don't justify the fees if the service is mediocre." — Client #CC-0056
- "I need year-end tax reporting for 3 entities across 2 jurisdictions. It's January 15th and I still don't have it." — Client #CC-0089

**Negative (alarming):**
- "I've moved $20M to UBS. Their client portal alone is worth the switch. I'm keeping the remaining $25M with you for now, but that's conditional on improvement." — Client #CC-0089
- "Thomas was the only person who understood our complex structure. Now he's gone and nobody has picked up the thread. We've had to re-explain our family setup to three different people." — Client #CC-0145
- "I will not be referring anyone else to Claudius Capital until the service improves. My reputation matters more than our relationship at this point." — Client #CC-0034
- "We received our Q3 report in November. November. That's 2 months late. Unacceptable." — Client #CC-0078
- "After 5 years with you, I expected better. The returns are good but I can get good returns elsewhere with better service. Consider this a warning." — Client #CC-0056

## Exit Interview Notes (Clients Who Left)

**Client #CC-0178 (Departed, $22M AUM)**
Reason: "Service deteriorated over the past year. Reports always late. Communication nonexistent between meetings. Moved to a competitor who provides real-time dashboard access and monthly personalized updates."

**Client #CC-0192 (Departed, $15M AUM)**
Reason: "Onboarding for our second entity was a disaster. 6 weeks of paperwork. Lost trust in the firm's ability to handle complexity."

**Client #CC-0199 (Departed, $18M AUM)**
Reason: "Nothing personal. Performance was fine. But when Alpine Wealth Partners showed us their client experience, we realized what we were missing. They have automated reporting, a client portal, and their RM always comes prepared."

## My Final Notes (Thomas — written December 28, 2025)

I'm leaving. I know that. And I know this data makes it look like I failed. Maybe I did.

But here's what I want whoever reads this to understand: the problem isn't one thing. It's everything. The systems don't talk to each other. The processes were designed for 50 clients, not 200. The team is running on fumes. And nobody has had time to step back and fix the foundations because we're too busy fighting fires.

The clients aren't wrong. The service isn't good enough for what we charge. But the solution isn't working harder — it's working smarter. Automation. Templates. Systems that scale.

I wrote a plan for automated reporting in Q3. I never got to build it. Please build it.

The firm is worth saving. The clients are worth keeping. The team is worth supporting.

Good luck.

— Thomas Reiter
