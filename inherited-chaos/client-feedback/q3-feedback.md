## Verbatim Comments

**Positive:**
- "Performance remains excellent. +16% YTD against a benchmark of +11%. Hard to argue with results." — Client #CC-0012
- "Marcus's market insights during the September call were invaluable." — Client #CC-0034
- "The new ESG integration into our portfolio is exactly what we wanted. Well executed." — Client #CC-0156

**Constructive:**
- "The returns are excellent. The communication is not." — Client #CC-0045
- "I should not have to ask for my quarterly report. It should arrive proactively." — Client #CC-0023
- "Your competitor at Goldman showed me a real-time dashboard. You sent me a Word document." — Client #CC-0089
- "Meeting prep seems rushed. My RM didn't know about the tax change that directly affects my portfolio. I had to bring it up myself." — Client #CC-0091
- "When I started with Claudius, Marcus knew my children's names. Now I get generic quarterly PDFs." — Client #CC-0056
- "The fee report is confusing. I showed it to my tax advisor and he couldn't parse it either." — Client #CC-0112
- "I've referred three families to you in the past. I'm hesitant to refer more right now because the service level has dropped." — Client #CC-0034
- "Suggested improvement: give us a proper client portal. Even my local bank has one." — Client #CC-0167

**Negative:**
- "We were approached by UBS last month. They showed us their reporting platform and client portal. It made our quarterly Word documents look amateur. I'm not leaving yet, but you need to catch up." — Client #CC-0089
- "I requested a proposal for my mother's estate 3 weeks ago. Still waiting. This is a $15M opportunity you're losing." — Client #CC-0078
- "Onboarding my business partner took so long that he gave up and went to Rothschild instead. That's a $20M loss for you. I hope you understand the gravity of this." — Client #CC-0203
- "The compliance review felt like a box-ticking exercise, not a genuine conversation about my family's needs." — Client #CC-0145

## Summary Notes (Thomas)
This is bad. NPS dropped 10 points in one quarter. Clients are now mentioning competitors by name (Goldman, UBS, Rothschild). We lost a referral and a direct prospect due to slow processes.

The pattern is crystal clear:
1. Investment performance = excellent (8.8/10, stable)
2. Everything else = declining

Clients love the product (returns). They're frustrated with the service (reporting, communication, onboarding, responsiveness).

If we don't fix this in the next 1-2 quarters, we'll start losing clients to competitors who can match our returns AND provide better service.

I flagged this to Marcus in my weekly update. He said "fix it." Working on it.
