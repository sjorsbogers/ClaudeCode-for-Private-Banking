## Verbatim Comments

**Positive:**
- "Strong returns in a difficult quarter. The team navigated the volatility well." — Client #CC-0012
- "Always feel well taken care of during our meetings. Sarah is exceptional." — Client #CC-0034
- "The investment thesis is clear and well-communicated. That gives us confidence." — Client #CC-0091
- "Happy to see the portfolio weathered the April correction as well as it did." — Client #CC-0145

**Constructive:**
- "Our Q1 report arrived almost 3 weeks into Q2. I should have it within the first week." — Client #CC-0023
- "I know you're growing fast, but it feels like things are slipping. Reports are late, emails take longer to get answered." — Client #CC-0056
- "The onboarding process for my wife's trust was painful. 4 weeks and 3 rounds of document submissions." — Client #CC-0067
- "Communication between quarterly reviews has dropped noticeably. I used to hear from my RM monthly. Now it's radio silence." — Client #CC-0078
- "I suggested a meeting prep document last quarter. Still waiting." — Client #CC-0089
- "Report formatting is inconsistent. My Q1 report looks different from my Q4 2024 report. Which is the right format?" — Client #CC-0112
- "Would love a digital dashboard instead of PDF reports. We're not in the 1990s." — Client #CC-0134

**Negative:**
- "Onboarding our family foundation took 5 weeks. I almost pulled the mandate. If it weren't for the returns, I would have." — Client #CC-0203
- "I feel like I'm managing my wealth manager, not the other way around. I shouldn't have to chase for updates." — Client #CC-0078
- "Three emails to get a simple portfolio update. That's not the level of service I expect for the fees I pay." — Client #CC-0156

## Summary Notes (Thomas)
Concerning quarter. Satisfaction is declining across nearly every category even though investment performance remains strong. The core complaint themes are emerging clearly: reporting delays, communication gaps, and onboarding friction. We need to address this before it becomes a retention issue.

Also noting: Client #CC-0078 gave negative feedback in both Q1 and Q2. Flight risk.
