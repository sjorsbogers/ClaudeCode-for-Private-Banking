# RFP / Pitch History — Notes & Learnings
# Last updated: November 2025 (by Sophie, with input from Marcus)

We've done maybe 15-20 pitches since Claudius Capital launched in 2019. I'm only documenting the last 3 here because they're the most relevant. Someone should go back and document the older ones too but honestly who has time.

## PITCH 1: Svensson Family Office — WON (June 2025)

**Client:** Erik and Margareta Svensson, Swedish industrialists
**AUM:** SEK 350M (~€30M at the time)
**Competition:** UBS, SEB Private Banking, Lombard Odier
**Lead RM:** Sophie Laurent
**Outcome:** WON. Mandate started August 2025.

### What happened:
The Svenssons were at SEB for 15 years. Unhappy with turnover — 4 relationship managers in 6 years. Wanted stability and personal attention. Also interested in impact/ESG investing (Margareta sits on the board of a Swedish environmental NGO).

We were introduced through the Bergström Foundation board (our existing client CC-006). Warm referral. This was HUGE — made us the default choice going in.

### Our pitch:
- Led with our boutique positioning: "You'll never be handed off to a junior"
- Sophie and Marcus presented together — showed them a two-person team that would be their dedicated contacts
- Heavy emphasis on ESG/impact capabilities (leveraged our Bergström Foundation case study — with permission)
- Showed our Nordic network and cultural understanding (Sophie speaks Swedish, which was a surprise to them)
- Fee: Competitive at 0.45% on total AUM (lower than our standard — Marcus was unhappy but Sophie pushed for it to win the mandate)

### What worked:
1. **Warm referral** — Cannot overstate how important this was. They trusted us before we walked in the door.
2. **Cultural fit** — We understood Nordic values (modesty, sustainability, long-term thinking). UBS showed up with a flashy presentation and it turned them off.
3. **ESG credibility** — Real track record, not greenwashing. Margareta grilled us and we passed.
4. **Personal touch** — Sophie remembered details from the initial meeting and followed up on them. "You mentioned Margareta's interest in Baltic Sea conservation — here's a fund that invests in marine sustainability." This small thing made a big impression.
5. **Transparency on fees** — We showed our fee waterfall clearly. Competitors were vague.

### What almost went wrong:
- Our pitch deck was from 2023 and had outdated AUM numbers. Sophie caught it the night before and Marcus updated it at 11pm. EMBARRASSING. We need a process for keeping materials current.
- The technology demo was... not great. They asked to see our client portal and it's outdated. Sophie pivoted to "we're upgrading our digital platform" which is... aspirational, let's say.
- The proposal document had a typo in Erik's name (spelled it "Eric"). Margareta noticed. Small thing but it matters.

### Key lesson: **Warm referrals + cultural fit + genuine expertise > brand name + flashy materials.**

## PITCH 2: Goldstein Family Trust — LOST (September 2025)

**Client:** David and Rachel Goldstein, US/Israeli dual nationals, based in Geneva
**AUM:** $85M
**Competition:** Goldman Sachs PWM (winner), Pictet, us
**Lead RM:** Marcus Webb
**Outcome:** LOST to Goldman Sachs.

### What happened:
David Goldstein sold his pharmaceutical company for $200M in 2024. Looking for a family office solution for a portion of the proceeds. Multi-generational wealth planning, US tax complexity, Israel exposure.

We were introduced through a Zurich law firm. Cold-ish referral — the lawyer recommended 3 firms including us.

### Our pitch:
- Positioned as boutique alternative to bulge bracket
- Emphasized personalized service and direct access to senior team
- Marcus presented investment strategy — strong on alternatives and PE
- Addressed US tax complexity (we have limited but some capability)

### Why we lost:
1. **Goldman Sachs brand** — For $85M, David wanted the Goldman name. "I need to know my money is at a firm that will be here in 50 years." Ouch.
2. **US tax capability** — We were honest that our US tax expertise is limited. Goldman has a full US tax team. For a US citizen, this matters enormously.
3. **Scale of platform** — Goldman offered access to their full PE deal flow, IPO allocations, direct lending, hedge fund co-investments. We can't match that.
4. **Technology** — David specifically asked about reporting and digital capabilities. Goldman demonstrated their Marcus Invest platform (confusingly named, our Marcus noted). It's impressive. Our portal... is not.
5. **Pricing** — Goldman actually UNDERCUT us on fees. They came in at 0.40% all-in for the first year. We offered 0.50%. They're buying market share and we can't compete on price.

### What we did well (but it wasn't enough):
- Marcus built great personal rapport with David. David said multiple times he liked us best as people.
- Our investment proposal was well-researched and thoughtful. David said it was the best of the three.
- We were transparent about our limitations (US tax). David respected this.

### The killer quote from David (relayed through the lawyer):
"If I had $20M, I'd go with Claudius in a heartbeat. They're the best for personal service. But at $85M with my complexity, I need Goldman's platform."

### Key lesson: **There's a client size/complexity threshold where boutique advantages get overwhelmed by platform capabilities. We need to be honest about where our sweet spot is. Probably $10-75M, European-based, without heavy US exposure.**

Also: **WE REALLY NEED TO FIX OUR TECHNOLOGY AND REPORTING.** This is the third time it's come up in a pitch. Clients expect digital-first in 2025.

## PITCH 3: Park Family Office — PENDING (November 2025)

**Client:** Min-Jun Park, Korean-American tech entrepreneur, based in Zurich
**AUM:** $55M (immediate), potentially $150M+ if he sells his company
**Competition:** Unknown — he's meeting "3-4 firms" but won't say who
**Lead RM:** Marcus Webb
**Outcome:** PENDING. Decision expected January 2026.

### What happened:
Min-Jun was referred by James Chen (CC-002). They're in the same Zurich tech community. This is another warm referral, which is great.

Min-Jun, 44, founded a cybersecurity company (currently ~$400M valuation). Not selling now but probably within 3-5 years. Looking for someone to manage his existing liquid wealth ($55M) with a view to a longer relationship when the liquidity event happens.

### Our pitch:
- Heavily leveraged the James Chen relationship (with James's permission — he even wrote a personal recommendation email)
- Focused on our tech sector understanding (Marcus can speak the language)
- Presented a growth-oriented portfolio with meaningful PE/VC allocation
- Addressed the eventual liquidity event: "We'll be ready when it happens, not scrambling to build a relationship at the last minute"
- Sophie presented the family/estate planning angle (Min-Jun has 3 young children)

### What we think went well:
- Min-Jun was engaged and asked great questions
- He liked our PE fund selection and asked about co-investment opportunities
- The James Chen referral clearly carries weight
- He appreciated that we're a boutique — "I don't want to be a small account at a big bank"

### Potential concerns:
- He asked about our "tech stack." Marcus talked about our systems in general terms. Min-Jun: "Can I see the portal?" We showed him. He was... quiet. Not a good sign.
- His lawyer is US-based and asked about our US regulatory capabilities. We were honest (limited).
- He mentioned wanting crypto exposure (5-10% of portfolio). We don't have a great solution for this yet.

### Follow up:
- Marcus sent a detailed follow-up proposal within 48 hours (good)
- We offered a trial period: 6 months at reduced fees to prove ourselves
- Min-Jun said he'd decide in January 2026

### Key lesson (preliminary): **Our client network is our biggest asset for new business. Both this pitch and the Svensson win came from client referrals. We should formalize a referral program.**

## PATTERNS ACROSS ALL PITCHES

### Why we win:
1. Personal relationships and trust
2. Warm referrals from existing clients
3. Investment expertise and thoughtful proposals
4. Boutique positioning (clients aren't a number)
5. Cultural sensitivity and language skills

### Why we lose:
1. **Technology and reporting** — consistently the weakest link
2. **Brand recognition** — we're unknown outside our network
3. **Platform limitations** — PE deal flow, IPO access, global tax
4. **Scale** — some clients outgrow us or need capabilities we don't have
5. **Pricing** — larger firms can undercut us as a loss leader

### What we need to fix (priority order):
1. **DIGITAL PLATFORM / REPORTING** — mentioned in every pitch. Cannot keep ignoring this.
2. Formalize referral program — our network is gold
3. Build US tax capability (hire or partner)
4. Create crypto offering (even if small, clients are asking)
5. Update pitch materials regularly (not the night before!)
