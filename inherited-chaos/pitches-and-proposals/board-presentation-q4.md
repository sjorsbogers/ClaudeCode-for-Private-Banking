# BOARD PRESENTATION — Q4 2025 REVIEW & 2026 OUTLOOK
## Claudius Capital Partners AG
### Draft v0.4 — Marcus Richter
### Board Meeting: 28 January 2026

**STATUS: DRAFT — DO NOT CIRCULATE**
*Thomas was going to help format this. Now I need to do it myself or ask Sarah. —M*

## SLIDE 1: Executive Summary

- AUM: CHF 8.5B (+6.2% YoY)
- Net new assets: CHF 340M (below CHF 500M target)
- Client retention: 96.8% (down from 98.1% in 2024 — lost Gruber family to Julius Baer, CHF 85M)
- Revenue: CHF 78.2M (ASK SARAH FOR FINAL AUDITED NUMBER)
- Operating margin: ~31% (estimate — need Finance confirmation)
- Headcount: 47 FTE (net +3 vs 2024, including Singapore hires)

**Key message to board:** Solid performance in a challenging year, but client service delivery is our Achilles heel. Technology and process investment are now urgent, not optional.

## SLIDE 2: AUM Development

```
[INSERT BAR CHART — need the one Sarah made for the investor letter]
```

| Year | AUM (CHF B) | YoY Growth |
|------|------------|------------|
| 2021 | 5.8 | +12.3% |
| 2022 | 5.4 | -6.9% (market) |
| 2023 | 6.5 | +20.4% |
| 2024 | 8.0 | +23.1% |
| 2025 | 8.5 | +6.2% |

Growth drivers 2025: Market appreciation (est. 60%), net inflows (est. 40%)
Growth drag: Gruber departure (-CHF 85M), Van Houten estate distribution (-CHF 42M)

*NOTE: 2024 growth figure includes the Tanaka mandate (CHF 1.1B) which was a one-off. Organic growth normalizing to 5-8% range. Board should understand this is healthy, not a slowdown.*

---

## SLIDE 3: Client Metrics

Total client families: 214 (up from 198)
Average AUM per family: ~CHF 39.7M
Top 20 clients: CHF 4.2B (49% of AUM — concentration risk noted)

**Client Segmentation:**
| Tier | Criteria | Count | AUM |
|------|----------|-------|-----|
| Platinum | >CHF 100M | 18 | CHF 3.8B |
| Gold | CHF 25-100M | 64 | CHF 3.1B |
| Silver | CHF 10-25M | 82 | CHF 1.3B |
| Standard | <CHF 10M | 50 | CHF 0.3B |

*Marcus note: We need to address the Standard tier. 50 clients generating minimal revenue but consuming RM time. Options: raise minimums, move to model portfolio service, or refer out. Board discussion needed.*

---

## SLIDE 4: NPS & Client Satisfaction

**Net Promoter Score trend:**
- Q1 2025: 62
- Q2 2025: 54
- Q3 2025: 51
- Q4 2025: 49 ← THIS IS A PROBLEM

*I'm not going to hide this from the board. We need their support for the technology investment.*

Industry benchmark (Capgemini HNWI survey): 52

**Top detractor themes:**
1. Reporting delays and quality (mentioned by 38% of detractors)
2. Technology/portal experience (29%)
3. Proactive communication (24%)
4. Fee transparency (19%)

**Top promoter themes:**
1. Investment performance (67%)
2. RM relationship quality (58%)
3. Event programme (41%)
4. Multi-jurisdiction capability (33%)

## SLIDE 5: Revenue & Profitability

ASK SARAH FOR NUMBERS — THESE ARE MY ESTIMATES

Revenue breakdown (estimated):
- Management fees: CHF 52M (~67%)
- Advisory fees: CHF 14M (~18%)
- Performance fees: CHF 8M (~10%)
- Transaction fees: CHF 4M (~5%)

Cost structure:
- Personnel: CHF 38M (49% — UP, need to discuss comp benchmarking)
- Technology & Infrastructure: CHF 6.5M (8%)
- Premises: CHF 5.2M (7%)
- Professional services: CHF 3.8M (5%)
- Other: CHF 2.5M (3%)
- **Operating profit: ~CHF 22.2M**

*Revenue per RM: CHF 4.9M (vs target CHF 5.5M)*
*Cost per client: ~CHF 257K (vs industry avg ~CHF 200K — we're expensive)*

## SLIDE 6: Investment Performance

UPDATE BEFORE MEETING — need CIO final numbers

Aggregate portfolio performance (model portfolios):
- Conservative: +4.8% (vs benchmark +4.2%)
- Balanced: +7.9% (vs benchmark +7.1%)
- Growth: +11.3% (vs benchmark +10.8%)
- Aggressive: +14.1% (vs benchmark +12.9%)

All mandates outperformed benchmarks net of fees in 2025. Strong year driven by:
- US equity overweight (thematic AI/tech exposure)
- Private equity co-investments (Alpine Fund II exits)
- Tactical CHF underweight

Underperformers:
- Fixed income (duration positioning too conservative in H1)
- Real estate (Swiss commercial RE softening)

## SLIDE 7: Competitor Landscape

**Key Competitor Activity 2025:**

| Competitor | What They're Doing | Threat Level |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| UBS GWM | Aggressive pricing on mandates >CHF 50M, new digital platform | HIGH |
| Pictet | Won 3 Swiss families from smaller firms, expanded SG office | MEDIUM |
| Julius Baer | Took our Gruber family, investing heavily in next-gen client engagement | HIGH |
| Lombard Odier | Strong ESG/sustainability positioning, approaching our ESG-interested clients | MEDIUM |
| EFG International | Price competition at lower end | LOW |
| Multi-family offices | Growing in number, targeting CHF 20-50M segment | MEDIUM |

**Emerging threats:**
- AI-native wealth platforms (not yet competitive for UHNW but improving rapidly)
- Large US firms entering European UHNW market (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley)
- Regulatory pressure increasing cost base for all players

**Our competitive moat:** Deep relationships, multi-jurisdiction capability, bespoke service. But "bespoke service" is exactly what's being undermined by our operations bottleneck.

## SLIDE 8: PROJECT PHOENIX — Technology & AI Investment Proposal

*This is the big ask. Need to frame it as risk mitigation, not just cost.*

**The Problem:**
Thomas's departure exposed critical single-person dependencies across operations. Reporting is slow, manual, and error-prone. Client portal is outdated. CRM adoption is inconsistent. We are losing NPS points — and will lose clients — if we don't modernize.

**The Proposal: "Project Phoenix"**
A 12-month initiative to:
1. Deploy AI-assisted client reporting (target: reduce report delivery from T+25 to T+10)
2. Build automated meeting preparation tools for RMs
3. Create AI-powered client insight dashboards
4. Modernize client portal (mobile-first)
5. Implement proper document management and search
6. Develop compliance-integrated tool framework (Raj's requirement)

**Budget Request:**
| Item | Cost (CHF) |
|------|-----------|
| Technology platform & tools | 350,000 |
| External consulting (implementation) | 200,000 |
| Staff training & change management | 100,000 |
| Contingency (15%) | 97,500 |
| **Total** | **747,500** |

*Is 747K enough? I worry it's too low for what we need but too high for what the board will approve. Maybe present as Phase 1 of a multi-year initiative. Phase 1: CHF 750K. Phases 2-3: TBD based on Phase 1 results.*

**Expected ROI:**
- Reporting time reduction: 60% → capacity freed = 1.5 FTE equivalent
- NPS improvement target: return to 60+ within 12 months
- Client retention target: 98%+ (saves ~CHF 85M in potential departures)
- RM productivity: 20% more client-facing time (less admin)
- Risk reduction: Less single-person dependency, better audit trail

**Timeline:** Phased rollout Q1-Q4 2026. Quick wins (reporting tools) in Q1-Q2.

*IMPORTANT: The new hire starting in operations is already scoped to help drive Phase 1. Not additional headcount — this is part of the existing budget.*

---

## SLIDE 9: 2026 Priorities (DRAFT)

1. **Stop the NPS bleeding** — reporting and technology improvements (Project Phoenix)
2. **Net new assets: CHF 500M target** — focus on Platinum/Gold tier prospects
3. **Succession planning** — Marcus to begin board discussion on leadership pipeline
4. **Singapore expansion** — hire 2 additional RMs, target 5 new Asian UHNW families
5. **ESG/Sustainability offering** — formalize as distinct service line (client demand is clear)
6. **Cost management** — address cost per client gap vs industry. Target: reduce to CHF 230K

---

## SLIDE 10: Risks & Challenges

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Key client departure (Van der Berg, Chen) | Medium | High | Relationship deepening, service improvement |
| Regulatory tightening (cross-border) | High | Medium | Raj's team monitoring, proactive compliance |
| Technology failure/delay | Medium | High | Phased approach, proven tools, dedicated resource |
| Key person risk (Marcus) | Low | Critical | Succession planning, team development |
| Market downturn | Medium | High | Diversified portfolios, defensive positioning |
| Cyberattack/data breach | Low | Critical | IT security review scheduled Q1 2026 |
