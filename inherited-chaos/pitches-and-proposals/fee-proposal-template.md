<!-- Thomas's note: this template is based on our old fee structure. We changed fees in January 2025 but I never updated this. Someone needs to update it before we send it to another prospect. -->

## CONFIDENTIAL FEE PROPOSAL

**Prepared for:** [CLIENT NAME]
**Date:** [DATE]
**Prepared by:** [RM NAME], Claudius Capital AG

---

### 1. Advisory Fee Schedule

Our standard advisory fee is based on total assets under management:

| AUM Tier | Annual Fee |
|----------|-----------|
| First CHF 10M | ~~0.75%~~ **0.65%** <!-- changed Jan 2025 --> |
| CHF 10M - 25M | ~~0.60%~~ **0.55%** <!-- changed Jan 2025 --> |
| CHF 25M - 50M | ~~0.50%~~ **0.45%** <!-- changed Jan 2025 --> |
| CHF 50M - 100M | ~~0.45%~~ **0.40%** <!-- changed Jan 2025 --> |
| Above CHF 100M | ~~0.40%~~ **0.35%** <!-- Negotiable for strategic accounts. Al-Rashid is at 0.30% for this tier. --> |

<!-- NOTE TO SELF: The Svensson mandate was done at 0.45% flat which is below our grid for their AUM. Sophie approved it to win the business. Do we formalize an exception process? -->

**Fee calculation:** Fees are calculated on the average quarterly AUM and billed quarterly in arrears.

**Minimum annual fee:** ~~CHF 50,000~~ CHF 75,000 <!-- Increased Jan 2025 to reflect higher operational costs. This means our minimum viable client is roughly CHF 12M AUM. Below that we're losing money. -->

---

### 2. Transaction Costs

<!-- OLD STRUCTURE — STILL IN TEMPLATE BUT MOSTLY REPLACED BY BUNDLED APPROACH -->

~~Listed securities: 0.15% per transaction (min CHF 50)~~
~~Fixed income: 0.10% per transaction (min CHF 50)~~
~~FX transactions: 0.05% on notional~~
~~Alternative investments: At cost, passed through~~

**NEW APPROACH (Jan 2025):** For most clients, we now bundle transaction costs into the advisory fee. The advisory fee above is all-inclusive for standard transactions.

Exceptions:
- FX transactions above CHF 1M: 0.03% on notional
- Alternative fund subscriptions/redemptions: At cost, passed through
- Real estate transactions: Separately quoted
- Structured products: Separately quoted

<!-- Marcus thinks we should go back to separate transaction fees because we're eating costs on high-turnover accounts. Sophie disagrees — she says bundled is simpler for clients and competitive advantage. Unresolved. -->

---

### 3. Performance Fee (Optional)

<!-- We almost never charge performance fees. Most clients refuse. James Chen (CC-002) specifically said no. Only relevant for aggressive mandates where the client sees it as alignment. -->

For performance-oriented mandates, an optional performance fee may apply:

- Performance fee: ~~15%~~ 10% of returns above the agreed benchmark
- High water mark: Yes
- Crystallization: Annual
- Benchmark: To be agreed with client (typically MSCI World or custom)

<!-- Honestly I don't think we've charged a performance fee to any client since 2022. Consider removing from template? Or keep for negotiation flexibility? -->

---

### 4. Custody Fees

Assets are held with our custodian partners:

| Custodian | Annual Fee | Minimum |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| ~~Credit Suisse~~ UBS (following merger) | 0.05% | CHF 5,000 |
| Lombard Odier | 0.04% | CHF 4,000 |
| Banque Cantonale de Genève | 0.06% | CHF 3,000 |

<!-- We should add Vontobel. We've been using them for some clients since mid-2025. Fee is 0.045%. -->

Custody fees are passed through at cost with no markup.

---

### 5. Additional Services

| Service | Fee |
|---------|-----|
| Financial planning & estate advisory | Included in advisory fee <!-- This is generous. We spend a LOT of time on this for some clients. Should we charge separately? --> |
| Tax reporting (Swiss) | Included |
| Tax reporting (international) | ~~CHF 2,500 per jurisdiction~~ **CHF 5,000 per jurisdiction** <!-- Increased because the actual cost was way higher, especially for complex structures --> |
| Consolidated reporting (multi-entity) | ~~Included~~ **CHF 10,000 per annum for structures with 4+ entities** <!-- New charge, added because Al-Rashid and similar structures are enormously time-consuming to report on --> |
| Sharia compliance screening | CHF 25,000 per annum <!-- Passed through from Dr. Al-Khatib. Considering bringing this in-house. --> |
| Philanthropic advisory | CHF 5,000 setup + CHF 2,500 annual |
| Concierge services | ~~Included~~ Discontinued <!-- We used to offer this as a differentiator but nobody used it except Mrs. Hoffman who asked us to help find a cat-sitter once --> |

---

### 6. Fee Comparison

<!-- Include this in the proposal to show we're competitive. Numbers are from our competitor research (mid-2024, should update). -->

| Provider | Typical Fee (€25M AUM) | Includes |
|----------|----------------------|----------|
| Claudius Capital | ~0.50% | Advisory + transactions + planning |
| Goldman Sachs PWM | 0.50-0.75% | Advisory only (transactions separate) |
| UBS Family Office | 0.40-0.60% | Advisory + basic transactions |
| Rothschild & Co | 0.55-0.70% | Advisory + transactions |
| Lombard Odier | 0.45-0.60% | Advisory + transactions |
| Alpine Wealth Partners | 0.55-0.65% | Advisory only |

<!-- These numbers are ROUGH and probably outdated. Goldman's pricing has gotten more aggressive — they undercut us on the Goldstein pitch. Need fresh competitive intel. -->

---

### 7. Special Provisions

**Fee review:** Annual review at client's request or upon significant AUM change (>20%).

**Fee holiday:** We occasionally offer reduced fees for the first 6 months for new clients. <!-- We did this for the Park pitch. Is this official policy or Marcus freelancing? -->

**Referral credit:** ~~Clients who refer new mandates receive a 10% fee reduction for one year.~~ <!-- This was Thomas's idea. Never formalized. Never actually implemented. But it's a good idea — our best new business comes from referrals. -->

---

### APPENDIX: Fee Revenue Model (INTERNAL — DO NOT INCLUDE IN CLIENT PROPOSAL)

<!-- Leaving this here for internal reference. Shows what each client tier actually generates in revenue. -->

| AUM | Annual Fee Revenue | Estimated Cost to Serve | Margin |
|-----|-------------------|------------------------|--------|
| CHF 10M | CHF 65,000 | CHF 60,000 | 8% |
| CHF 25M | CHF 137,500 | CHF 85,000 | 38% |
| CHF 50M | CHF 225,000 | CHF 120,000 | 47% |
| CHF 100M | CHF 400,000 | CHF 200,000 | 50% |
| CHF 200M | CHF 700,000 | CHF 350,000 | 50% |

<!-- Key insight: Clients below CHF 15M are marginally profitable at best. Below CHF 10M we're probably losing money. This is why the CHF 75K minimum fee matters.

But we have several clients in the CHF 10-15M range that we took on early and haven't re-priced. O'Sullivan Trust (CC-007) at €12.5M is paying about CHF 56,000/year in fees. Santos Legacy (CC-014) is even worse — $15.8M but dormant, generating almost nothing.

Thomas was building a profitability analysis by client. Where is that file??? -->

**DOCUMENT STATUS: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS A COMPLETE OVERHAUL.**
- Fee schedule: Updated for Jan 2025 changes but messy (tracked changes in markdown, really?)
- Competitor data: Outdated (mid-2024)
- Custody section: Missing Vontobel
- Performance fee section: Probably irrelevant, consider removing
- Internal appendix: Useful but should be a separate document
- Version control: "v2.1" — there is no v1 or v2 that I can find

Thomas was supposed to create a clean v3 before he left. He didn't.
