## GOLDMAN SACHS PWM

### What they do well:
- **Platform is unmatched.** IPO allocations, PE deal flow (Petershill Partners gives them unique access), direct lending, structured products — they can do anything.
- **Technology:** Their digital reporting platform (Marcus Invest / Ayco platform for UHNW) is years ahead of us. Real-time portfolio view, scenario modeling, tax optimization tools. Clients love it.
- **Brand:** For certain clients, the Goldman name is what they want. Prestige, perceived safety, global reach.
- **Research:** 800+ analysts globally. Their morning call is legendary. We literally subscribe to their research ourselves.
- **Global reach:** Offices in every major financial center. If a client moves from Zurich to Singapore, they don't need to change banks.

### Where they're vulnerable:
- **Impersonal at our scale:** A $30M client at Goldman gets a junior relationship manager. At Claudius, they get Sophie or Marcus directly.
- **Product pushing:** Multiple clients have told us they left Goldman because they felt like every meeting was a sales pitch for Goldman products. Proprietary funds, structured notes — the conflict of interest is real even if they manage it better than they used to.
- **Turnover:** RM turnover is high. The Svenssons specifically cited this as why they left SEB (not Goldman, but same problem at big banks generally).
- **Fees:** They CAN be expensive, especially when you add up advisory + transactions + custody + product fees. But they've also gotten aggressive on pricing to win strategic accounts (see Goldstein pitch — they undercut us).
- **Swiss/European clients:** Their Swiss presence is strong but they're fundamentally an American firm. Cultural nuances can get lost.

### Recent moves:
- Expanding European family office team aggressively
- Launched a "sustainable investing" platform (playing catch-up on ESG)
- Acquired a boutique tax advisory firm in London (strengthening their tax capabilities — this is a direct competitive threat)

### Our strategy vs. Goldman:
Don't compete head-on. We lose. Instead:
- Target clients who VALUE personal relationships over platform
- Target European-centric clients where our local knowledge matters
- Target $15-60M AUM sweet spot where they're underserving clients
- Emphasize independence and lack of product conflicts

## UBS FAMILY OFFICE

### What they do well:
- **Global reach + Swiss heritage.** Best of both worlds. They can credibly serve a family from Zurich to Hong Kong.
- **Multi-entity/multi-jurisdiction mastery.** Their booking centers (Zurich, Singapore, Hong Kong, London) and trust company (in Jersey, Liechtenstein, etc.) make them very strong for complex families.
- **Reporting platform:** UBS Wealth Management Office — genuinely good. Consolidated multi-entity reporting, real-time access, good mobile app.
- **Sustainability/ESG:** Strong commitment, good product range, credible impact measurement.
- **Scale of offering:** Art advisory, philanthropy, real estate advisory, private markets — full service.

### Where they're vulnerable:
- **Post-Credit Suisse integration chaos.** The CS merger (completed 2024) has been messy. Some ex-CS clients are unhappy and looking around. This is an opportunity window for us.
- **Bureaucracy.** Large bank processes. Onboarding takes months. Simple requests go through three layers of approval. We've won clients who were frustrated by this.
- **Standardization vs. customization.** They SAY they're bespoke but at 20,000+ clients, there's a limit to how custom they can be. Model portfolios dominate.
- **Regulatory scrutiny.** After the French tax evasion scandal and the CS Greensill/Archegos issues, they're under intense regulatory scrutiny. This makes them conservative/slow on new things.

### Recent moves:
- Major push into Asia (especially China/HK/SG family offices)
- Launched UBS Sustainability Hub
- Upgrading tech platform post-CS integration
- Hired several boutique RMs (including one person we were looking at — lost them on comp)

### Our strategy vs. UBS:
- Target the CS integration refugees. There are clients in Switzerland right now who are unhappy and open to alternatives.
- Emphasize speed and agility. We can make decisions in days, they take weeks.
- Personal touch. Client knows their RM, their RM knows their family.
- We can't match their global reach but we can be deeper in our niche.

## ROTHSCHILD & CO (Wealth Management)

### What they do well:
- **Heritage and trust.** 200+ years. For traditional European families, this resonates deeply.
- **European expertise.** Strongest in France, UK, and Switzerland. Very good with European industrialist families.
- **Advisory approach.** Genuinely advisory (not product-pushing). Similar to our philosophy.
- **Client-to-RM ratio.** Better than bulge bracket. They provide genuine personal service.
- **Succession planning.** They've been doing multi-generational wealth planning for longer than anyone. Their expertise here is real.

### Where they're vulnerable:
- **Technology.** Reporting and digital capabilities are behind Goldman and UBS. Similar to our problem actually.
- **Alternative investments.** Limited direct access to PE/VC. They rely on third-party managers like we do.
- **Growth trajectory.** They're growing but slowly. Not a lot of innovation happening.
- **US capability.** Weak. If a client has US connections, Rothschild is not the answer.
- **Not truly independent.** Rothschild family still has significant influence. Some clients perceive this as a conflict.

### Our strategy vs. Rothschild:
Honestly, they're our closest competitor in terms of philosophy and positioning. The main differentiators are:
- We're newer, more agile, more willing to innovate
- We're (slightly) cheaper
- We have better Sharia/Islamic finance capability
- They have better brand recognition and heritage
- It often comes down to personal relationships — whoever the client clicks with

## ALPINE WEALTH PARTNERS

### Overview:
Boutique family office based in Zug, founded 2015 by former Julius Baer team. ~CHF 2.1B AUM, approximately 85 clients. Direct competitor in the Swiss boutique space.

### What they do well:
- **Extreme personalization.** 15:1 client ratio means every client gets white-glove service.
- **Real estate expertise.** Their founding partner, Stefan Keller, came from real estate. They have a dedicated RE team that sources direct deals. This is a genuine differentiator.
- **Swiss-focused.** They know Swiss tax, Swiss real estate, Swiss regulatory landscape better than anyone.
- **Client experience.** Beautiful offices, excellent events (they hosted a client ski weekend in Verbier last year that everyone talked about), personal touches.

### Where they're vulnerable:
- **Scale.** CHF 2.1B is small. Can they survive if a few big clients leave? Concentration risk.
- **Geography.** Swiss-focused is a strength but also a limitation. If a client needs Asia or Middle East expertise, they can't help.
- **Investment platform.** Limited PE/VC access. No Sharia capability. No dedicated alternatives team.
- **Succession risk.** Stefan Keller IS Alpine Wealth Partners. If he leaves or retires, what happens?
- **No research team.** They outsource investment research entirely. This means they're dependent on third parties for investment ideas.

### IMPORTANT — Recent development:
**Alpine Wealth Partners won the Hoffmann account away from us in Q3 2025.**

The Hoffmanns (not to be confused with our CC-004 Hoffman Estate) were a prospect we were cultivating. Swiss family, CHF 40M, conservative, real estate heavy. We thought we were in a strong position. Alpine came in with a direct real estate co-investment opportunity (a logistics development in Basel) that we couldn't match. The client loved Stefan's personal involvement and the tangible asset story.

This hurt. It's exactly the kind of client we should be winning.

Marcus's take: "We need a real estate direct investment capability. Even if it's through a partnership, we can't keep losing deals because we can only offer funds."

Sophie's take: "It wasn't just the real estate. They felt like Stefan cared about them more than we did. Volume is hurting our service quality."

Sophie is right. When you have 40:1 client ratio vs their 15:1, something has to give.

### Our strategy vs. Alpine:
- We're bigger and more diverse. More investment options, more jurisdictions, more capabilities.
- We need to fix our client ratio problem. 40:1 is too high. Either hire more RMs or be more selective about new clients.
- Consider a partnership for direct real estate access.
- Don't underestimate them. Stefan is sharp and ambitious.

## OVERALL STRATEGIC TAKEAWAYS

1. **Our core advantage is relationships.** We win when clients value personal attention and trust over brand and platform. Protect this at all costs.

2. **Technology is our Achilles heel.** Every competitor is ahead of us on reporting and digital tools. This is repeatedly cited in pitches, in client feedback, and by our own team. IT MUST BE ADDRESSED.

3. **We're in a dangerous middle ground.** Too big to provide Alpine-level intimacy (40:1 ratio), too small to match Goldman/UBS platform. We need to pick a direction.

4. **Growth is creating quality problems.** 200+ clients with ~5 senior people is not sustainable. We're spreading thin and it shows.

5. **Our niche strengths are real.** Sharia compliance, ESG/impact, European focus, multi-gen planning — these are genuine differentiators. We should lean in harder.

6. **Referrals are our growth engine.** Nearly every successful pitch came through an existing client referral. This is cheap, high-conversion, and trustworthy. We should formalize it.

7. **The competitor to watch is Alpine.** They're in our sweet spot and they're better at what we claim to be best at (personal service). They're small now but growing.
