# New Fund Onboarding — Compliance Checklist (DRAFT)
# Started by Raj Patel, October 2025
# STATUS: INCOMPLETE — do not use as final version

This is supposed to be our standard checklist for onboarding new fund investments. I started building it after the near-miss with the Al-Rashid Sharia compliance issue. We clearly need a more systematic process.

## NOTES TO SELF (Raj):

This checklist is probably 70% complete. Major gaps:

1. **Cybersecurity section** — FINMA's new circular requires us to assess cyber risk of our counterparties. I have no idea how to do this efficiently for fund managers. Need to research best practices.

2. **ESG section** — Too thin. With the EU Taxonomy and SFDR requirements, we need a proper ESG DD framework. Not just a checkbox.

3. **Sharia section** — Currently it's 3 checkboxes. For Al-Rashid, we need a comprehensive Sharia DD process. Should probably be a separate document.

4. **Tax section** — We need a tax specialist involved in every fund onboarding. Currently we do tax as an afterthought.

5. **Who signs off?** — We don't have a clear approval hierarchy. Is it the RM? The investment committee? Compliance? All three? Need to define.

6. **Timing** — This whole process currently takes 4-6 weeks. Can we get it to 2-3 weeks without cutting corners?

7. **Template vs. reality** — We have this checklist but nobody uses it consistently. The culture is "just do the deal." I've pushed back on this and gotten pushback in return. Need management support.

I'm going to present a proposal to standardize our DD process at the next team meeting. If I ever get invited to a team meeting. (Half-joking.)
