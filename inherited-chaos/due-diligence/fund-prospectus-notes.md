## 1. Apex Innovation Partners Fund III

**Type:** Venture Capital / Growth Equity
**Vintage:** 2025
**Target size:** $500M (first close: $280M)
**GP:** Apex Innovation Partners (San Francisco / London)
**Minimum commitment:** $2M
**Fee structure:** 2/20 with 8% preferred return, European waterfall

### What we know:
- Referral from James Chen (CC-002). His Stanford classmate Alex Moreno is a GP.
- Focus: Enterprise AI, fintech infrastructure, healthcare AI
- Fund I (2018): 2.1x TVPI, 18% net IRR (top quartile)
- Fund II (2021): 1.4x TVPI so far (still early, 40% deployed)
- Portfolio includes 2 unicorns from Fund I: DataMesh (enterprise data) and ClearPath Robotics

### Positives:
- Strong track record in Fund I
- Sector expertise aligns well with our tech-oriented clients
- Alex Moreno has genuine operator background (built and sold a company)
- Fund II pace of deployment is disciplined — didn't spray money around in 2021 like others
- LP base is high quality (Stanford endowment, a few prominent family offices)

### Concerns:
- Fund III is a meaningful step-up in size (Fund I was $150M, Fund II was $300M, now $500M). Can they scale without losing returns?
- Team has grown from 4 to 11 in two years. Some junior partners are very junior.
- **Alex Moreno is the star. If he gets hit by a bus, what happens? Key person risk is HIGH.**
- No European portfolio companies yet despite having a London office. What's the London office actually doing?
- The Stanford connection with James makes this slightly awkward — we need to be objective

### Status: Need to schedule on-site DD visit to SF office. Marcus to lead.

### Recommendation: TENTATIVE POSITIVE — but need to resolve key person concern and size step-up question.

## 2. Pan-European Logistics Real Estate Fund III

**Type:** Real estate (logistics/warehouse)
**Vintage:** 2025
**Target size:** €750M
**GP:** Nordic Property Partners (Stockholm)
**Minimum commitment:** €5M
**Fee structure:** 1.25% management / 15% carried interest over 7% hurdle

### What we know:
- Fund I (2017): 1.8x, 14% net IRR — excellent
- Fund II (2020): 1.6x so far, on track for 12-13% net IRR
- Focus: Last-mile logistics, cold chain, automated warehouses
- Geographies: Nordics, Benelux, DACH, increasingly Southern Europe

We already committed €15M from Al-Rashid Trust (CC-003) in Q4 2025. Capital call expected Q1 2026.

### Positives:
- E-commerce structural tailwind for logistics RE
- Nordic Property Partners has excellent sourcing network
- Fund II had zero write-downs even through COVID
- ESG credentials strong — all new builds to BREEAM Excellent standard
- Bergström Foundation (CC-006) could also be interested (impact angle)

### Concerns:
- European logistics RE has gotten expensive. Cap rates compressed significantly since 2020
- Fund III is targeting Southern European expansion — different market dynamics, do they have expertise?
- Currency risk for USD/CHF-denominated portfolios
- €750M is a big fund for this niche. Deployment risk?

### Status: DD largely complete. Investment committee approved for Al-Rashid. Still evaluating for other clients.

### Recommendation: POSITIVE for diversified portfolios with RE allocation. Good fit for conservative clients seeking inflation protection.

## 3. Sigma Systematic Global Macro Fund

**Type:** Hedge fund (systematic macro)
**AUM:** $3.2B
**GP:** Sigma Capital Management (London / Singapore)
**Minimum commitment:** $1M
**Fee structure:** 1.5/15 with high water mark

### What we know:
- Live track record since 2014
- Annual returns (net): 2020: +22%, 2021: +8%, 2022: +14%, 2023: +6%, 2024: +11%, 2025 YTD: +9%
- Sharpe ratio: 1.4 (very strong)
- Max drawdown: -7.2% (March 2020)
- CTO is former Goldman Sachs quant. Team of 35 (15 researchers, 12 engineers, 8 ops)
- We have $2.5M allocated from Chen Tech Holdings (CC-002)

Honestly not much new to add here. We've been in this fund since 2022, it's performing as expected. Annual DD call is in February — Marcus to attend.

### Status: Existing allocation. Monitoring. No action needed.

## 4. Claudius Direct Lending Fund II (internal)

**Type:** Direct lending (mid-market European corporates)
**Vintage:** 2024
**Target size:** €200M (our own fund)
**Fee structure:** 0.85% management / 10% carry over 5% hurdle (preferential terms for Claudius Capital clients)

This is our own fund so DD is a bit different. Raj handles compliance side.

### Current status:
- 65% deployed across 18 positions
- Average yield: 8.2% gross
- No defaults to date
- Largest position: €15M to a German automotive supplier (3.8% of fund)

### Concerns (internal, honest assessment):
- Concentrated in DACH region (Germany/Austria/Switzerland = 70% of portfolio)
- Two positions in cyclical sectors (automotive, construction) that could be vulnerable in downturn
- Our credit analysis team is small (3 people). Are we doing enough monitoring?
- LP reporting has been inconsistent — investors have complained about late quarterly reports. THIS IS PARTLY THE MANUAL REPORTING PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS EVERYTHING.

### Status: Ongoing. Next LP report due February 2026.

## 5. Meridian Ventures Fund IV

**Type:** Venture capital
**Vintage:** 2023
**Target size:** $400M (oversubscribed, closed at $450M)
**GP:** Meridian Capital (New York / Tel Aviv)
**Minimum commitment:** $3M
**Fee structure:** 2/20

### What we know:
- We have $3M committed from Chen Tech Holdings
- 40% deployed into 12 portfolio companies
- One standout: LogiFlow AI (Series B logistics AI company) — marked up 3x
- Fund I, II, III all top-quartile performers

### The concern nobody's talking about:

I was doing background research on Meridian's latest regulatory filings and noticed that their Chief Compliance Officer left in August 2025 — that's the third CCO departure in four years. The first two were explained away (one retirement, one "personal reasons") but three in four years is a pattern.

Also: Meridian's co-founder David Reisner was named in a 2024 SEC inquiry related to his previous fund (not Meridian, but a prior vehicle called Pinnacle Growth Partners). The inquiry was reportedly closed without action, but I can't confirm this from public filings. The mention was in a Bloomberg brief that I can't find anymore.

Is this anything? Maybe not. But combined with the CCO turnover, it makes me uncomfortable. I flagged it to Marcus in September. He said "good catch, let me look into it." I don't think he did.

**SOMEONE NEEDS TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS.** We have a fiduciary duty to our clients.

### Status: Monitoring. RED FLAG pending resolution.

## GENERAL NOTES ON DD PROCESS

Our due diligence process is inconsistent. Some funds get full write-ups (like Apex above), others get a paragraph. There's no standard template. Thomas started creating one but I don't know where it is.

We should standardize:
1. Quantitative assessment (returns, risk metrics, peer comparison)
2. Qualitative assessment (team, strategy, alignment of interests)
3. Operational DD (admin, audit, compliance infrastructure)
4. Reference checks (existing LPs)
5. Ongoing monitoring framework

Currently we do some of these things some of the time for some funds. That's not good enough for a firm managing $8.5B.

Also — our DD files are scattered. Some in SharePoint, some in personal email folders, some in hard copy in the filing cabinet (yes, really). We need to centralize this.
