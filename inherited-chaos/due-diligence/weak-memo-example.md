## WHY THIS MEMO IS WEAK (Teaching Notes)

This memo would fail IC review at a well-run firm. Here's what's missing:

### 1. No Conviction Challenge
- Where is "What could make this thesis wrong?"
- No bear-case scenarios presented
- No discussion of conditions that would change the recommendation
- Marcus would ask: "You've told me why it's good. Tell me why it might not be."

### 2. No Peer Comparison
- "Good returns" — compared to what? The benchmark? The peer group?
- No mention of competing funds in the same strategy space
- How do fees compare to alternatives?
- The IC can't evaluate this fund in isolation — they need context

### 3. No Concentration Analysis
- How concentrated are the top holdings?
- What % of returns come from the top 2-3 positions?
- If the top holding drops 30%, what happens to the portfolio?
- This is a hidden risk that should be explicitly analyzed

### 4. Generic Risk Assessment
- "Market risk" is listed but not quantified
- No severity × likelihood matrix
- No mitigation strategies
- No base-rate analysis (what's the historical probability of a tech selloff of X%?)
- Listing "manager departure risk" without discussing key-person provisions, bench depth, or succession plan

### 5. No Manager Due Diligence Depth
- "Experienced team" — how experienced? Who are they? What's the turnover?
- No operational due diligence (admin, audit, custody)
- No assessment of alignment of interests (co-investment, fee structure incentives)
- No reference checks mentioned

### 6. Missing Compliance Section
- No suitability assessment
- No MiFID II compliance review
- No mention of which client profiles this is suitable for (beyond "growth and aggressive")
- Raj would block this immediately

### 7. Vague Recommendation
- "5% allocation" — of what? Total portfolio? Alternative allocation?
- No conditions for approval
- No monitoring triggers (when should we reassess?)
- No exit strategy

### Compare This To a Strong Memo
A strong memo would include:
- Conviction score with explicit reasoning
- Pre-mortem: 3 scenarios where this investment fails
- Peer comparison table (5 alternatives on 8+ metrics)
- Concentration risk analysis with top-holding stress test
- Manager assessment with 7-point scoring matrix
- Risk matrix with severity × likelihood × mitigation
- Base-rate analysis for key risk scenarios
- Explicit suitability mapping to client profiles
- Compliance sign-off section
- Conditions for approval and monitoring triggers
