## Meeting 1: Nordic Property Partners — Pan-European Logistics Fund III

**Date:** September 18, 2025
**Location:** Claudius Capital, Zurich office (Bahnhofstrasse 42)
**Attendees:**
- Claudius Capital: Sophie Laurent, Marcus Webb, Raj Patel (compliance)
- NPP: Erik Lindqvist (Managing Partner), Anna Björk (Fund Manager), Thomas Henriksson (IR)

**Duration:** 2 hours 15 minutes

### Opening / Firm Overview
Erik opened with NPP history. Founded 2012 in Stockholm. Now €4.2B AUM across 5 funds and 3 separate accounts. 45 employees across Stockholm, Helsinki, Amsterdam, and Munich. Munich office is new (opened 2024, 6 people).

NPP's thesis: European logistics real estate is structurally undersupplied. E-commerce penetration in Continental Europe is 10-15 years behind UK/US. Cold chain infrastructure is "woefully inadequate for the protein transition." Automated fulfillment centers are the next big theme.

Sophie asked about Southern European expansion (new for Fund III). Anna responded — they've hired a local team in Milan (3 people) and have pipeline of 6 deals in Italy and Spain. Cap rates are 100-150bps wider than Northern Europe, which they see as attractive relative value.

Marcus challenged: "Do you have the local relationships and regulatory expertise to execute in these markets?" Erik: "That's exactly why we hired locally. Two of our Italian team came from CBRE and have 15+ years of local experience." Fair answer but we should verify.

### Fund III Specifics
- Target: €750M, first close at €480M achieved
- Target net IRR: 10-12% (lower than Fund II target of 12-14%, reflecting market maturity)
- Target equity multiple: 1.6-1.7x
- Fund life: 5+2 years
- Leverage: 50-55% LTV (conservative for RE)
- ESG: All new builds to BREEAM Excellent, existing assets to be upgraded within 24 months of acquisition

Pipeline: €2.1B of identified opportunities. They're being "very selective" — targeting 15-20 acquisitions at €30-50M each.

### Performance Review (Fund I and II)
Anna walked through historical performance. Fund I: 1.82x / 14.1% net IRR, fully realized. Fund II: 1.58x / estimated 12.5% net IRR, 70% realized. No write-downs in either fund. Impressive.

Raj asked about valuation methodology. Annual third-party appraisals by Cushman & Wakefield, quarterly internal marks. Raj was satisfied with the process.

### Key Questions
1. **Sophie:** "What's your biggest risk right now?" Erik: "Interest rates. If rates stay higher for longer, cap rates could widen further and our exit timing matters more. We model for multiple scenarios." He showed sensitivity analysis — even in a bear case, Fund III returns are projected at 7-8% net. Acceptable.

2. **Marcus:** "What happens if e-commerce growth slows?" Anna: "We're not just playing e-commerce. Cold chain, pharma logistics, data center adjacency — these are our growing themes. Less than 40% of Fund III will be pure e-commerce logistics."

3. **Raj:** "Any regulatory or compliance issues in any fund?" Erik: "No. Clean record. Happy to provide all regulatory filings." He seemed genuinely unconcerned. Either clean or well-prepared.

### Action Items
- NPP to provide full regulatory and compliance documentation
- NPP to arrange site visit to two Fund II assets (Amsterdam and Munich)
- Claudius to provide commitment letter for Al-Rashid Trust allocation (€15M)
- Follow-up call in 4 weeks for any outstanding questions

### Sophie's Assessment: "Strong fund. Good team. Track record speaks for itself. I'm comfortable with the allocation for CC-003. Worth considering for CC-006 (Bergström) and CC-010 (Williamson) as well."

## Meeting 2: Apex Innovation Partners — Fund III

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Location:** Video call (they're in SF, we're in Zurich)
**Attendees:**
- Claudius: Marcus Webb
- Apex: Alex Moreno (GP), Priya Sharma (Partner), Jennifer Wu (IR)

**Duration:** 1 hour

Notes are sparse because I was multitasking (bad, I know) — Marcus

- Alex pitched Fund III. Same thesis as Fund I/II but broader mandate to include growth equity (pre-IPO rounds, not just early stage)
- Fund I track record review: 2.1x TVPI. DaaMesh and ClearPath Robotics are the winners. Rest of Fund I is decent but not spectacular. Those two deals drive most of the alpha.
- Priya presented Fund II update. Still early but she seemed confident. Healthcare AI vertical is apparently looking very good.
- I asked about the size step-up (from $300M to $500M). Alex: "We've built the team. We have the pipeline. And frankly, our best deals come from our network, and that network has only gotten stronger." He mentioned that 3 of his Fund I founders have referred deals. Interesting but self-serving.
- Key person clause: I asked directly. Alex confirmed he has a 5-year commitment to the fund and the key person clause would trigger a suspension period if he departed. Priya would become acting lead. She seems capable but I haven't done enough DD on her specifically.
- Fees: Standard 2/20. No discount for us. Alex: "We're oversubscribed, we're not discounting." Fair enough at this stage but worth pushing if we commit a larger amount.

**My take: I like Alex. He's legit. But Fund I returns are driven by 2 outliers and I want to understand the base rate better. Also, the team growth from 4 to 11 is fast — culture can deteriorate. Need on-site visit.**

TODO: Schedule in-person visit to SF office. Bring Sophie if possible. Look at Fund I portfolio company data in detail.

STATUS: SF visit not yet scheduled. James Chen (CC-002) is pushing us to commit. Let's not rush.

## Meeting 3: Meridian Capital — Fund IV Update (LP meeting)

Date: Nov 5 2025
Virtual. Marcus attended.

Brief notes:
- Standard LP update call
- 12 portfolio companies, $180M deployed
- LogiFlow AI is the star — 3x markup
- Two other companies doing well (unnamed — they were cagey about details)
- Three companies "tracking to plan" which in VC speak means mediocre
- They didn't mention the CCO departure. I didn't ask on the group call — didn't want to spook other LPs
- David Reisner was on the call. He seemed fine. Normal. Professional.
- New GP commit: they invested $15M of their own capital. Good alignment.
- Next fund (Fund V) likely to launch 2027. Early signal they'll want us to re-up.

I need to follow up privately with their IR person about the CCO situation and the SEC inquiry thing. Have been putting it off because it's an awkward conversation. But it needs to happen.

Note to self: call Jennifer Park at Meridian IR before end of November.

DID I DO THIS? I honestly can't remember. Check email.
