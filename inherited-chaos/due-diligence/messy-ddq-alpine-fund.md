Called Capital: ~55%
Early performance indicators are broadly positive. Portfolio consists of 6 investments to date. Two markups in Q3 2024. Full track record data available under NDA — see Attachment C.

*Past performance is not indicative of future results.*

We note that Fund I benefited from favorable exit timing (2019–2020 multiples). Fund II deployment was impacted by COVID-related delays but has recovered well. Fund III is too early for meaningful return attribution.


## 4) Risk Management

Alpine employs a robust risk management framework broadly in line with industry best practices.

- Portfolio concentration limits: No single investment >15% of committed capital
- Sector diversification targets maintained (see Anlagerichtlinien, available on request)
- Currency hedging: selective, typically 50-80% of non-CHF exposure
- Leverage: Fund-level leverage not employed. Portfolio company leverage assessed case-by-case per the IC
- Valuation: Quarterly NAV, annual third-party valuation (currently performed by Duff & Phelps)
- ESG integration: We are a signatory to the UN PRI and conduct ESG due diligence on all investments. Our ESG policy is attached (see Attachment D).

Stress testing and scenario analysis are conducted as part of investment decision-making. Methodology available upon request.

**Key risk factors:**
Concentration risk (European mid-market), currency risk, illiquidity, key person risk, regulatory/political risk (EU regulatory environment)

We do not currently employ a dedicated Chief Risk Officer. Risk oversight is the responsibility of the IC, chaired by Dr. Hofer.
