# Quarterly Performance Notes - Claudius Capital
## Compiled by various RMs — not consistent, sorry

### Q3 2025

**Van der Berg Family (CC-001)**
Portfolio returned +2.1% in Q3 vs benchmark +2.8%. Underweight equities hurt relative performance but client specifically requested lower equity exposure after the April volatility. Fixed income sleeve performed well, +1.4% absolute.

Hendrik van der Berg called Sophie on August 3rd asking about crypto allocation for the grandchildren's tranche. Sophie told him we'd look into it. DID WE FOLLOW UP?? Need to check.

Multi-gen meeting scheduled for September but pushed to October due to Hendrik's travel.

**Chen Tech Holdings (CC-002)**
Great quarter. +8.7% net of fees. The Meridian Ventures Fund IV allocation paid off — their Series B in that logistics AI company marked up 3x. Marcus very happy with this one.

James Chen wants to increase PE allocation to 40% of portfolio. Currently at ~25%. Marcus flagged this as potentially too concentrated but James is pushing. Need investment committee review.

Note: James mentioned he's in talks to sell his company. If that happens we're looking at potentially $200M+ in new assets. PRIORITY.

**Al-Rashid Trust (CC-003)**
- Q3 return: +3.2% (Sharia sleeve: +2.9%, sukuk portfolio: +1.8%)
- Compliance review completed — all holdings confirmed compliant as of July 31
- New sub-trust established for daughter Fatima's education fund ($2.5M)
- Mohammed Al-Rashid expressed concern about real estate concentration in Dubai — wants to diversify into European logistics properties
- Sophie handling, coordinate with Zurich office for the European RE piece

**Hoffman Estate (CC-004)**
Performed well. ~+3% I think. Thomas had the details but he's gone now.

UPDATE: Found Thomas's notes — Q3 return was +2.6%. Balanced mandate performing in line. No major changes requested. Mrs. Hoffman turning 80 in November, might want to review estate planning.

**Nakamura Holdings (CC-005)**
Yen weakness complicated things. Portfolio up +4.1% in JPY terms but flat in USD. Marcus discussed hedging strategy with Kenji Nakamura — agreed to hedge 50% of FX exposure going forward.

Japanese equity sleeve outperformed (+6.2%) but international allocation dragged.

**Bergström Foundation (CC-006)**
Impact portfolio doing well. +3.8% with 100% ESG compliance maintained. The renewable energy fund (Nordic Green Power II) was the top performer at +12% for the quarter.

Board meeting in September — Sophie presented performance. Board asked about expanding into social impact bonds. We said we'd prepare analysis.

WE STILL HAVEN'T DONE THE SOCIAL IMPACT BOND ANALYSIS. It's been 4 months.

**O'Sullivan Trust (CC-007)**
+1.2%. Fine for a FI-heavy portfolio in this environment. Duration positioning helped when rates came down in August.

Sean O'Sullivan hasn't responded to last two review meeting requests. Thomas was managing this — someone needs to pick it up.

**Petrova Family Office (CC-008)**
+7.3% gross, +6.8% net. Aggressive mandate paying off. Russian exposure fully unwound as of Q2 (compliance requirement), redirected to Eastern European ex-Russia basket.

Natasha Petrova wants to discuss philanthropic structure. $5M commitment to arts foundation. Tax implications need review — she's Monaco resident but assets in multiple jurisdictions.

**De Luca Partners (CC-009)**
Real estate sleeve flat (0.2%). Alternatives portfolio +4.5%. Blended ~+2.8%.

Marco De Luca VERY unhappy about the real estate performance. Sent strongly worded email August 15th. Sophie met with him in Milan August 22nd, smoothed things over, but he wants monthly updates on RE sleeve going forward.

This is now a HIGH TOUCH client. Don't let this slip.

**Williamson & Daughters (CC-010)**
+1.9%. Conservative wealth preservation doing its job. Margaret Williamson is content. Annual review completed September 5th — no changes to IPS.

Thomas managed this one. Clean, simple, no issues. Model client honestly.

### Q4 2025

**Van der Berg Family (CC-001)**
Q4 return: +1.8%. Full year 2025: +9.2% (their target is 6-8% so good result).

Multi-gen meeting finally happened November 12th. Present: Hendrik (patriarch), Annelies (wife), Pieter (son, running the business), Eva (daughter, lives in Singapore).

KEY OUTCOME: Eva wants a separate mandate for her portion (~€8M). She's more growth-oriented than the family trust. This could be a new account. Sophie following up.

Succession planning discussion was productive but emotional. Hendrik wants to formalize everything before his 75th birthday (March 2026). URGENT.

**Chen Tech Holdings (CC-002)**
Q4: +3.2%. Company sale fell through — James was disappointed but portfolio held up. PE allocation discussion still pending — investment committee hasn't met on this yet. WHY NOT??

Marcus — please schedule IC review for January. This has been sitting since August.

**Al-Rashid Trust (CC-003)**
Complicated quarter.
- Main trust: +2.1%
- Dubai RE marked down -3.2% (as Mohammed feared)
- Sukuk portfolio: +1.1%
- New European logistics RE allocation initiated: €15M committed to Pan-European Logistics Fund III

Compliance flag: One of the equity holdings (Meridian Consumer Fund) had a position in a company that derived 7% of revenue from non-compliant activities. Caught in Q4 screening. Position divested immediately, replaced with compliant alternative. No client notification yet — NEED TO DISCLOSE TO MOHAMMED.

**Hoffman Estate (CC-004)**
Q4 return not calculated yet?? It's January and we still don't have this.

Someone please pull the data. I think it's around +2% but don't quote me on that.

**Petrova (CC-008)**
Strong finish. +5.1% in Q4, full year +22.4% gross. Natasha very happy.

Philanthropic structure set up — Petrova Arts Foundation, $5M initial funding, annual commitment of $500K from portfolio income. Tax optimization through Monaco structure confirmed with external counsel.

Natasha referred us to two potential new clients — a tech founder and a former diplomat. Marcus following up.

**Everyone else** — I'll update these notes when I get the final December numbers from ops. Some NAVs still pending on the alternatives side. Target to finalize by January 15th.

**GENERAL NOTES:**
- We're behind on Q4 reporting AGAIN. Same issue as every quarter — manual process, too few people, too many clients
- Thomas leaving really hurt capacity. His clients (CC-004, CC-007, CC-010, CC-014) need to be redistributed. Sophie and Marcus already overloaded
- The Kim Family (CC-016) onboarding is taking forever. Started in October, still not complete. They're getting frustrated
- Need to discuss hiring at next team meeting
- Raj (compliance) flagged that 3 client reviews are overdue. This is a regulatory risk
