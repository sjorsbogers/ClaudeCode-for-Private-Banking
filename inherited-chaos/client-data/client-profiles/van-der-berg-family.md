## Family Overview

Patriarch: Hendrik van der Berg, 74 (turns 75 March 2026)
Wife: Annelies van der Berg, 71
Son: Pieter van der Berg, 48 — runs Van der Berg Logistics BV (Rotterdam)
Daughter: Eva van der Berg-Tan, 42 — married to David Tan, lives in Singapore since 2019

AUM: €45.2M (as of Sep 2025 — probably higher now with Q4 performance)
   - Family trust: ~€37M
   - Pieter's individual: ~included in trust?? need to check
   - Eva's portion: ~€8M (wants separate mandate — discussed Nov 2025)

Currency: EUR primarily, some USD and SGD exposure
Risk profile: Conservative. Hendrik is VERY conservative. "I didn't build this to gamble it away" — direct quote from onboarding in 2019

## How We Got Them

Referred by their lawyer at De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek in 2019. They were at ABN AMRO private banking, unhappy with lack of personal attention after their RM left. We pitched personalized multi-generational service. Won on the personal touch + Sophie's Dutch language skills.

Original AUM at onboarding: €38M. Has grown to €45.2M through performance + additional deposits from Pieter (~€3M from business sale in 2022).

## Investment Policy Statement (summary)

Target return: 4-6% net of fees (updated 2023 — was 3-5% originally)
Maximum drawdown tolerance: -8% in any 12-month period
Equity allocation: 25-35% (currently at 28%)
Fixed income: 40-50% (currently 44%)
Alternatives: 10-20% (currently 15% — mostly real estate)
Cash: 5-10% (currently 13% — Hendrik likes a buffer)

ESG: Soft preference for ESG, no hard exclusions except tobacco and weapons
Geographic: Home bias towards European assets, especially Netherlands/DACH region

**Rebalancing**: Quarterly, with 5% tolerance bands

## Key Relationships & Dynamics

Sophie is primary RM. Has excellent relationship with Hendrik and Annelies. Meets them quarterly in Rotterdam, usually at their home or at Hotel New York (Hendrik's favorite).

Pieter is pragmatic, business-focused. Wants clear numbers, doesn't care about the frills. He's sometimes frustrated by what he sees as overly conservative approach. Has hinted multiple times about moving some allocation to growth equity. Sophie manages this diplomatically.

Eva is the interesting one. Since moving to Singapore, she's become much more globally minded. Her husband David works in fintech (COO at a Series C company). She wants:
- More growth exposure
- Some crypto allocation (small, 2-3%)
- Exposure to Asian markets, especially SEA
- Separate reporting from the family trust

This creates family tension. Hendrik thinks crypto is "tulip mania" (his words, multiple times). Eva thinks the family is too conservative. Pieter is somewhere in the middle.

**The succession issue is the big one.** Hendrik wants to formalize wealth transfer before his 75th birthday (March 2026). This involves:
1. Restructuring the trust
2. Defining Pieter's and Eva's allocations
3. Setting up governance for when Hendrik is no longer involved
4. Tax planning across Netherlands, Singapore, and potentially Switzerland (they have a chalet in Verbier)

## Meeting History (selected)

**2025-11-12 — Multi-generational meeting (Amsterdam office)**
Present: Hendrik, Annelies, Pieter, Eva (video from Singapore)
Sophie + Thomas (his last meeting before leaving)

- Reviewed 2025 YTD performance (+7.4% at the time, ahead of target)
- Hendrik opened succession discussion. Emotional — Annelies teared up at one point
- Agreed in principle: 60% to Pieter, 40% to Eva
- Eva formally requested separate mandate with different risk profile
- Pieter wants to establish a charitable foundation (tax benefits + genuine interest in education)
- Action items:
  * Sophie to draft separate IPS for Eva's mandate
  * Legal to review trust restructuring options
  * Tax team to analyze NL/SG cross-border implications
  * Follow up meeting January 2026

**STATUS OF ACTION ITEMS: UNKNOWN. Thomas was tracking these and then left. Sophie — please confirm where we are on these???**

**2025-09-15 — Annual review (Hendrik & Annelies home, Rotterdam)**
Standard review. Performance good. No major changes.
Hendrik asked again about cash drag — Sophie explained opportunity cost but he was firm on keeping 10%+ in cash. "When you've seen what I've seen in the 80s, you keep powder dry."

Annelies mentioned wanting to gift €500K to each grandchild (4 grandchildren) for education. Need to structure this tax-efficiently. Was this actioned?

**2025-06-20 — Mid-year review (Hotel New York, Rotterdam)**
Quick meeting, mostly social. Hendrik was in good spirits. Markets doing well.
Eva joined by phone — she raised the crypto question here for the first time.
Hendrik: "Over my dead body." (half-joking, half-not)

**2025-03-10 — Q1 review**
Standard. Discussed adding allocation to European infrastructure. Agreed to 3% allocation to Claudius Infrastructure Fund I.

## Communication Preferences

Hendrik: Phone calls. Does not use email regularly. His assistant Marta handles correspondence. Formal letters for important matters.
Annelies: Not involved in investment decisions but always present at meetings. Appreciates being included.
Pieter: Email, brief and to the point. No unnecessary meetings. Monthly portfolio snapshot is enough.
Eva: WhatsApp or email. Wants digital access to portfolio. Has complained twice that our client portal is "from 2010."

## Fees

Advisory fee: 0.45% on first €20M, 0.35% above €20M
Transaction costs: Charged separately, ~0.15% drag
Total effective fee: ~0.55%

Hendrik negotiated hard on fees at onboarding. "Pieter, he haggles like buying herring at the Markthal" — Sophie's note.

If Eva gets separate mandate, need to agree separate fee schedule. She'll probably compare to digital platforms. Be prepared.

## Risks & Concerns

1. **Succession planning timeline is TIGHT.** March 2026 is 3 months away. We're behind.
2. **Eva could leave.** If we don't accommodate her separate mandate quickly, she may move to a more modern platform. She's mentioned Alpian and StashAway to Sophie.
3. **Thomas's departure** left a gap — he was very involved in the trust restructuring analysis
4. **Cross-border complexity** — NL, SG, CH tax implications are significant. Do we have the expertise in-house or do we need external counsel?
5. **Hendrik's health** — not discussed explicitly but Annelies has made subtle comments. Succession planning may be more urgent than the March deadline suggests.

## Random Notes (from various people)

- Hendrik's birthday party invite went to the whole team last year. Nice gesture. Make sure we send something for his 75th. BIG milestone.
- Pieter's daughter Lotte is studying at Erasmus University, Rotterdam. Finance major. He mentioned wanting her to intern somewhere in wealth management. Opportunity??
- The family's logistics company (Van der Berg Logistics BV) has annual revenues of ~€180M. Pieter is considering selling a majority stake in the next 5 years. If that happens, potentially another €50-80M in assets. STRATEGIC importance.
- Eva sent Sophie a really nice message when her baby was born last year. Relationship is genuine.
- Annelies loves orchids. Sophie always has orchids in the meeting room when they visit. Small things matter.
