## Background

James founded DataPulse AI in San Francisco in 2016. Computer vision / enterprise analytics. Grew to 400 employees, $45M ARR. Moved to Zurich in 2021 for "quality of life" but really I think it was tax optimization (Marcus's note — don't include in formal docs obviously).

Company status: Was in acquisition talks with a major tech company (rumored to be Salesforce but James wouldn't confirm) in Q3 2025. Deal fell through in October. James was disappointed but philosophic about it. Company still doing well, probably valued at $300-500M.

IF A SALE HAPPENS: We're looking at $150-200M+ in new assets. This is our biggest growth opportunity. Marcus is all over it.

## Meeting Notes (reverse chronological, kind of)

### December 9, 2025 — Zurich office
- James came alone (Lisa traveling)
- Reviewed Q4 performance, he was satisfied
- MAIN TOPIC: PE allocation increase. He wants 40% of portfolio in PE/VC. Currently at 25%.
- Marcus's view: Too concentrated, liquidity risk, we should cap at 30-35%
- James: "I understand venture better than any of your analysts. I've built a company. I know which metrics matter."
- Marcus pushed back diplomatically. Agreed to present 3 scenarios at next IC meeting
- James also interested in direct co-investments alongside our PE funds. Wants deal flow access.
- Mentioned a new fund — Apex Innovation Partners Fund III — his Stanford friend is a GP. Wants us to evaluate it.
- ACTION: Marcus to get Apex fund docs and initiate DD

### October 15, 2025 — Phone call (Marcus + James)
Deal fell through. James sounded tired. Said the acquirer tried to lowball at the last minute.
- "I'm going to build this to $100M ARR and then they'll come back at 3x the price"
- Discussed portfolio implications — no major changes needed since we hadn't positioned for a liquidity event
- James: "Let's be more aggressive. If I'm not selling the company, I want the portfolio working harder"
- This is when the 40% PE push really started

### August 22, 2025 — Zurich office (lunch meeting at Kronenhalle)
Marcus, James, Lisa present
- Lisa very engaged in this meeting. She wants ESG/impact overlay on part of the portfolio
- James: "Fine, but don't sacrifice returns for feelings" (direct quote, Lisa rolled her eyes)
- Agreed to explore 10% allocation to impact investments for Lisa's "sleeve"
- James mentioned Meridian Ventures Fund IV marking up — very pleased
- Asked about crypto. Marcus said we can do up to 5% through regulated vehicles
- James: "I already have a personal Coinbase account with $2M in BTC and ETH. I want something more sophisticated."
- ACTION: Explore institutional crypto exposure options — DID WE DO THIS?

### June 3, 2025 — Video call
Quick check-in. Markets up, James happy. No changes.
Lisa asked about setting up a foundation. Early stages, no specifics.

### March 2025 — Annual review (Zurich office)
Full review meeting, 2 hours.
- 2024 performance: +18.3% (James: "Should have been 20+")
- IPS review — no changes to risk tolerance
- Discussed succession / estate planning. James was dismissive: "I'm 38, we'll deal with that later"
- Marcus flagged it again. "You have $28M in assets and a company worth hundreds of millions. You need a plan."
- James: "Fine. Put something basic together. But I'm not spending 3 meetings on it."
- ACTION: Draft basic estate plan framework — STATUS: Not done. Marcus got pulled into other things.

## Investment Strategy

**Current Allocation (approx Q3 2025):**
- Public equities: 35% ($9.8M)
  - Heavy tech/growth tilt (surprise surprise)
  - Individual stocks: NVIDIA, ASML, TSMC, Microsoft, Alphabet
  - ETF sleeve for broader exposure
- Private equity / venture: 25% ($7M)
  - Meridian Ventures Fund IV — $3M commitment, 60% called
  - Claudius Direct Lending Fund II — $2M
  - Two direct co-investments — early stage AI companies ($1M each)
- Fixed income: 15% ($4.2M)
  - Short duration, mostly IG corporate
  - James: "Bonds are boring but Marcus insists"
- Alternatives: 15% ($4.2M)
  - Hedge fund (Sigma Systematic Fund) — $2.5M
  - Gold / commodities — $1.7M
- Cash: 10% ($2.8M)
  - Too high. James keeps it for "dry powder" to deploy into opportunities

**Proposed Changes (pending IC approval):**
1. Increase PE/VC to 35-40% (James wants 40%, Marcus recommends 35% max)
2. Add impact/ESG sleeve — 10% ($2.8M) — Lisa's request
3. Reduce fixed income to 10%
4. Add crypto allocation — up to 5% ($1.4M)
5. Reduce cash to 5%

## Risk Profile

Risk tolerance: Aggressive
James has high risk capacity (young, high income from company, no dependents)
Maximum drawdown tolerance: -20% (James said -25% but Marcus put -20% in the IPS to be safe)
Time horizon: 10+ years
Liquidity needs: Low (company income covers lifestyle)

## Fee Structure

Management fee: 0.50% flat (James negotiated hard, standard is 0.65% for this size)
Performance fee: None (James refused — "I don't pay performance fees, that's a hedge fund game")
Fund fees: Passed through at cost
Transaction costs: Bundled into management fee (concession we made to win the account)

Total effective cost: ~0.65% including fund fees

James reviews fees annually. Has threatened twice to move to a lower-cost platform. Each time Marcus convinced him by demonstrating alpha.

## Personal Notes

- James is intense, direct, sometimes impatient. Doesn't like small talk. Get to the numbers.
- Lisa is warmer, more strategic thinker. She's the one who thinks about long-term family planning.
- They entertain a lot — regular dinners with Zurich's tech community. Good referral source.
- James plays competitive tennis. Marcus played with him twice (lost both times).
- Drives a Tesla Model S. Very interested in sustainability but frames it as tech/innovation not emotion.
- His mother lives in Taipei, his father passed away 2021. This is partly why the estate planning conversation is sensitive — he saw how complicated it was when his father died without a proper plan.
- ALLERGY: severe nut allergy. Important for any events/dinners. We messed this up at the summer client event last year. Very embarrassing.

## Competitive Threats

- James has a friend who moved to Lombard Odier. He's mentioned their digital platform approvingly.
- Also looked at iCapital for direct PE deal flow.
- His company's CFO uses Goldman Sachs PWM and keeps telling James how good their reporting is.
- We need to step up our digital game or we'll lose him. He's 39, not 74. He expects tech-first.

## Key Risks

1. Company sale — could be massive opportunity (new assets) or risk (if he decides to consolidate at a bigger bank)
2. PE concentration — if he gets his way on 40%, one bad vintage could significantly impact portfolio
3. Estate planning gap — no will, no structured succession despite significant wealth
4. Lisa influence — she may push for more impact allocation than makes sense for the return target
5. Crypto — regulatory landscape still evolving, reputational risk if we get this wrong
6. He's the kind of client who reads the FT every morning and will email Marcus about any article that mentions our funds. High maintenance.
