==========================================================

1. FAMILY STRUCTURE
==========================================================

Mohammed Al-Rashid — Patriarch, 62. Kuwaiti national. Based in Kuwait City primarily, London residence (Knightsbridge), chalet in Gstaad.
- Built wealth through Al-Rashid Construction Group, one of the largest construction/infrastructure companies in the Gulf. Company sold to Saudi consortium in 2018 for reportedly $800M+. His share after family split and taxes: approximately $350M total wealth.
- We manage approximately $120M. Rest is direct real estate, operating businesses, and at other institutions (JPM in London, NBK in Kuwait).

Layla Al-Rashid — Wife, 55. Very involved in philanthropic activities. Runs the Al-Rashid Foundation (education focus, primarily MENA region). Does NOT get involved in investment decisions.

Children:
- Khalid, 34 — Works in family's remaining real estate business in Kuwait. Conservative like his father. Married, 2 children.
- Fatima, 29 — PhD in economics at LSE. Very sharp. Increasingly involved in trust governance. Mohammed is grooming her for a larger role. (Note: this is unusual and progressive — Mohammed specifically wants his daughter involved)
- Omar, 26 — Lives in LA. Works in "entertainment" (unclear what exactly). Mohammed doesn't discuss Omar much. There may be family tension here. Do NOT bring up Omar unprompted.

==========================================================

2. TRUST STRUCTURE (this is a mess, I know)
==========================================================

MAIN ENTITIES:

Al-Rashid Family Trust (Jersey)
├── Al-Rashid Investment Holdings Ltd (BVI)
│   ├── Listed securities portfolio ($52M)
│   ├── Sukuk portfolio ($18M)
│   └── Alternative investments ($22M)
├── Al-Rashid Real Estate Holdings Ltd (Dubai)
│   ├── Dubai properties (8 units, valued ~$28M — but valuation is from 2023 and probably lower now)
│   └── London property (Knightsbridge flat — £8.5M, not sure if this is in scope or personal)
├── Fatima Education Fund (Jersey) — established Q3 2025
│   └── $2.5M initial funding
└── Al-Rashid Foundation (Kuwait) — philanthropic, separate governance
    └── $5M endowment (we manage), annual distribution ~$200K

ALSO:
- There's a Cayman structure that I think is dormant? Thomas set it up in 2020 for some fund investment and it might still have assets. Need to verify.
- Mohammed personally holds some positions outside the trust that he asks Sophie about informally. These are NOT in our AUM numbers but we give advice on them. Compliance implication?? Raj — thoughts?

==========================================================

3. INVESTMENT MANDATE — SHARIA COMPLIANCE
==========================================================

THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. ALL investments must be Sharia-compliant.

Screening criteria:
- No alcohol, tobacco, pork, gambling, adult entertainment, weapons (conventional or nuclear)
- No conventional financial services (banks, insurance) unless Islamic finance
- Debt-to-equity ratio must be < 33% (some scholars say 30%, we use 33% per our Sharia board's guidance)
- Interest income must be < 5% of total revenue
- Non-compliant revenue purification: any inadvertent non-compliant income must be donated to charity

Sharia Supervisory Board:
We use Dr. Ahmed Al-Khatib (based in Bahrain) as external Sharia advisor. He reviews the portfolio quarterly. His reports are filed with compliance.

IMPORTANT COMPLIANCE NOTE from Q4 2025:
We identified a holding in Meridian Consumer Fund that had a position in a company with ~7% revenue from non-compliant activities. This was caught in our Q4 screening. Position was divested immediately.

** HAS MOHAMMED BEEN NOTIFIED?? As of my last update (Jan 5 2026) I don't think so. This MUST happen. He will be upset but more upset if he finds out later that we delayed telling him. Sophie — please handle this personally and DOCUMENT the conversation. **

Purification: The profit from the non-compliant holding (~$12,000) needs to be donated to charity per Sharia requirements. Process with Raj.

4. INVESTMENT STRATEGY
==========================================================

Target allocation:
| Asset Class | Target | Current (Sep 2025) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global equities (Sharia-screened) | 30% | 32% | Use Claudius Sharia Equity Fund + individual positions |
| Sukuk & Islamic FI | 20% | 15% | Mohammed wants to increase this |
| Real estate | 25% | 23% | Heavy Dubai, wants to diversify to Europe |
| Private equity | 15% | 18% | Some older commitments still being called |
| Cash & money market | 10% | 12% | Islamic money market only |

Target return: 5-7% net of fees
Risk profile: Moderate-Conservative
Maximum drawdown: -10%
Benchmark: Custom — 30% MSCI World Islamic / 20% Dow Jones Sukuk / 25% FTSE EPRA NAREIT Developed / 15% Cambridge PE / 10% SOFR

Problems with current allocation:
1. Real estate too concentrated in Dubai (80% of RE sleeve). The Q4 markdown showed why this is risky.
2. Sukuk portfolio underweight vs target — yields have been unattractive, we've been parking in cash instead
3. PE allocation slightly above target due to capital calls — need to rebalance when distributions come
4. No exposure to European real estate yet despite Mohammed's explicit request. Pan-European Logistics Fund III commitment made in Q4 but capital not called yet.

==========================================================

5. KEY CONCERNS & PRIORITIES (from various meetings, not well organized)
==========================================================

FROM SOPHIE'S MEETING NOTES (August 2025, Kuwait City):
"Mohammed is concerned about three things: (1) Dubai real estate concentration, (2) making sure all investments remain fully Sharia-compliant — he said he'd been reading about some Islamic funds that were 'cutting corners' and he doesn't want that, (3) preparing Fatima to take a more active role in the trust governance.

He also mentioned — almost casually — that he might establish a family office in Zurich or Geneva within the next 2-3 years. If that happens, he'd want Claudius Capital to be the anchor manager. This could mean $200-300M under our management if he consolidates. Sophie didn't push on this but it's a HUGE opportunity."

FROM KHALID (phone call with Marcus, September 2025):
- Khalid handles day-to-day real estate decisions for the trust
- Wants quarterly valuation updates on Dubai properties
- Asked about selling 2-3 units and redeploying into logistics/warehouse
- "Father wants European exposure but I think we should also look at Singapore and KL"
- Marcus said he'd look into it — DID HE?

FROM FATIMA (email to Sophie, October 2025):
"Sophie, I've been reviewing the trust documents and I have some questions about the governance structure. Can we schedule a call? Also, I'm writing my PhD thesis on Islamic finance and sustainable investing and would love to discuss how these frameworks could be integrated into our investment approach. I think there's an interesting overlap between ESG and Sharia screening that we're not exploiting."

Sophie's reaction: "This girl is brilliant. We need to take her seriously. She'll be running this trust within 5 years."

Was the call scheduled?? I don't see it in the calendar.

FROM RAJ (compliance, November 2025 email to Sophie):
"Sophie, I need the updated beneficial ownership documentation for the Jersey trust. The JFSC is asking questions as part of their review cycle and our records show the last UBO declaration is from 2022. This needs to be refreshed urgently. Also, the Cayman structure (Al-Rashid Investment Holdings II) — is this still active? If not, we need to wind it down properly. There are annual fees accruing."

STATUS: ???

==========================================================

6. FEE STRUCTURE
==========================================================

Tiered advisory fee:
- First $50M: 0.55%
- Next $50M: 0.40%
- Above $100M: 0.30%

Blended rate on $120M: approximately 0.42% = ~$500K per year

Additional:
- Sharia advisory board fee: $25,000/year (passed through to client)
- Real estate advisory: 0.25% of RE AUM = ~$70K
- Transaction costs: at cost, approximately $80K/year

Total revenue from Al-Rashid: approximately $675K/year

This is our second most profitable client relationship after Müller Industriebeteiligungen (CC-015).

Note: Fee was last reviewed 2023. Mohammed hasn't asked for a renegotiation but as AUM grows (especially if he consolidates), he will. We need to be ready with a proposal that shows value for money.

==========================================================

7. RISKS
==========================================================

1. COMPLIANCE: Sharia compliance breach = potential loss of client. Zero tolerance. The Q4 incident MUST be handled perfectly.

2. REGULATORY: Multi-jurisdiction structure (Jersey, BVI, Dubai, Cayman, Kuwait, UK, Switzerland) = complex regulatory landscape. We need to make sure we're not missing anything. Post-CRS, reporting requirements have multiplied.

3. CONCENTRATION: Dubai RE and single-region sukuk exposure.

4. SUCCESSION: Mohammed is 62 and in good health but the trust governance is not ready for transition. Fatima is capable but young. Khalid is involved but in real estate only. Omar is... not involved.

5. COMPETITIVE: JPMorgan manages a significant portion of Mohammed's London assets. They're pushing to consolidate. We've heard through Sophie that JPM's Zurich office has been making overtures.

6. GEOPOLITICAL: Gulf region exposure, sanctions landscape evolving. We need to stay very current on OFAC/EU sanctions lists.

7. OPERATIONAL: Honestly, servicing this client properly takes a disproportionate amount of time. Between Sharia screening, multi-entity reporting, multiple family members, multiple jurisdictions... this is probably a 3-person job and it's split across Sophie, Marcus, and Raj with no one person owning it fully.

==========================================================

8. RANDOM NOTES / TO-DO
==========================================================

- Mohammed's driver in Zurich is named Hassan. Always arrange airport pickup when he visits. The Dolder Grand hotel, always the same suite (Junior Suite 412).
- Halal catering for ALL meetings. Use Marrakech Lounge for lunch meetings in Zurich. Do NOT book a regular restaurant and assume they'll have halal options. (This happened once in 2023 and was embarrassing.)
- Mohammed's birthday: April 15. Send a gift. Last year Sophie sent a first edition book on Islamic architecture. He loved it.
- Ramadan: Be aware of timing. No meetings during Ramadan unless Mohammed initiates. Eid greetings are appreciated.
- Fatima is vegetarian (unusual in the family, apparently it's been "a thing")
- Khalid prefers Arabic-language documents when available. Our reports are English only. Is there a way to provide Arabic summaries?
- The Gstaad chalet — Mohammed has mentioned wanting to discuss Swiss real estate as an investment (not just personal). But this is sensitive because of Swiss regulations around foreign ownership. Don't raise unless he does.
- Thomas was building a consolidated multi-entity report template for this client. It was maybe 60% done when he left. Where is this file??? It would save hours every quarter.

LAST THING: If Mohammed ever asks about "the situation with Omar" just say you're not aware of the details and refer to Sophie. There's apparently a significant family issue that we should not be involved in. Sophie knows the boundaries.
