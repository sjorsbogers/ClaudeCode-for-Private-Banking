# THE THOMAS FOLDER
## Client Notes — Miscellaneous
### Found on Thomas Keller's network drive (H:\Clients\Notes\)
### Retrieved by Sarah Chen, 6 January 2026

*Context: These are Thomas's personal working notes on client relationships. Some overlap with Salesforce records, some don't. Formatting is... Thomas. I've copied them here as-is for the new ops hire to review. Some of this is gold. Some of it is Thomas being Thomas. —Sarah*

## Van der Berg Family

**Friedrich Van der Berg — Patriarch**
- NEVER call before 10am. He takes his mornings very seriously (exercise, reading). Once called at 9:15 and got an earful. Put it in the CRM but Elena keeps forgetting.
- Prefers email for routine updates, phone for anything important. Does NOT like the portal — "I'm not logging into another system."
- Art collection is his passion. Contemporary, mostly German and Dutch artists. Has a Gerhard Richter that he talks about constantly. We hosted a private viewing at Hauser & Wirth last March — he brought his wife and stayed 3 hours. Best engagement we've had.
- Politically conservative. Does not want ESG "ideology" in his portfolio. But his daughter (Sophia, early 30s) is very ESG-minded. Potential tension point as wealth transfers.
- Annual review always in person, Zurich. He flies in from Amsterdam. Prefers Thursday or Friday meetings. Lunch at Kronenhalle after — he books it himself but appreciates when we offer.
- Wine: Burgundy. Don't bring Bordeaux.
- Estate planning is becoming urgent — Dutch tax law changes. He's aware and anxious about it. Elena is coordinating with Amsterdam counsel.
- Risk tolerance: moderate. Gets nervous in drawdowns. Held our hand through the 2022 correction — daily calls for two weeks. Came out fine but it cost us time.

**Marta Van der Berg — Wife**
- Not involved in investment decisions. Attends social events. Charming. Speaks German, Dutch, limited English.

**Sophia Van der Berg — Daughter**
- Lives in Berlin. Works in sustainable fashion. We've barely engaged her. This is a risk — if Friedrich passes and Sophia inherits, she could easily move the money to a firm with better ESG credentials.
- NOTE TO SELF: Suggest Elena arranges a coffee with Sophia next time she's in Zurich. No pitch — just relationship building.

## Chen Family

**Wei Chen — Patriarch, Singapore-based**
- Formal. Address as Mr. Chen. First names only after he initiates (Marcus is on first-name basis, Priya is not yet).
- All meeting materials in Mandarin AND English. Non-negotiable. We learned this the hard way in 2023.
- Events: always ensure Mandarin-speaking staff available. At the SG launch dinner, we didn't — Wei noticed and mentioned it to Marcus.
- Succession planning in progress. Complex: 3 children, 2 jurisdictions (SG + UK), different family trusts. David Loh (external counsel) is excellent and Wei trusts him completely. Always include David in structural discussions.
- Jun (third son) — sensitive topic. There's a family dispute. Wei does NOT want Jun involved in governance or decision-making. Don't ask why. Don't bring it up. If Jun contacts us directly, refer to Wei or David Loh immediately.
- Li-Na (daughter, London) — the future. Smart, Oxford-educated, asks tough questions. Will be the primary contact within 5-10 years. We MUST build this relationship independently. She's more informal than Wei — first-name basis is fine with her.
- Portfolio preference: Wei is conservative on public markets, aggressive on PE and real estate. Wants exposure to SE Asian growth.
- Gift protocol: Chinese New Year — we send a tasteful gift (premium tea, high quality, no cheap branded items). Thomas handled this. SOMEONE NEEDS TO TAKE OVER.

## Morrison Family Trust

**Lady Catherine Morrison**
- Title: Lady. Use it. She notices.
- Widowed 2019. Husband (Sir Robert Morrison) was the original client. She inherited everything and took a more active interest than anyone expected.
- Sharp, opinionated, used to getting her way. Will not hesitate to call Marcus directly if she's unhappy.
- Fee sensitivity is increasing — not because she can't afford it, but because she feels we're not always delivering value for the premium. The Q3 advisory fee issue (Thomas's mess — see separate file) has made this worse.
- Trust restructuring has been "on hold since August" — this is urgent but she keeps postponing. I think there's a family reason (her son Edward is apparently difficult). Don't push but keep it on the agenda.
- The Morrison Trust holds roughly CHF 180M with us. Significant reputational value too — she knows everyone in Zurich society.
- NEVER schedule meetings on Tuesdays — she has something (charity board? Medical? Never asked). Thursday mornings work best.
- She likes strong opinions from her RM. Don't be wishy-washy. Elena is good at this.

**Edward Morrison — Son**
- Lives in London. Minimal engagement with us. Thomas met him once — described him as "difficult." No further detail. This is a succession risk.

## Al-Rashid Family

**Fatima Al-Rashid — Primary Contact (next-gen)**
- Dubai-based. 28 years old. Oxford, then worked at McKinsey Dubai briefly. Now runs the family office.
- VERY tech-savvy. Asks about our technology. Has compared our portal to DBS's iWealth (unfavorably). If we don't modernize, we'll lose this family.
- Interested in: sustainable sukuk, impact investing, Singapore real estate.
- Shariah compliance for ~30% of portfolio. This is non-negotiable for the family's older generation but Fatima is pragmatic — she sees it as a constraint to work within, not a rigid framework.
- Her father (Ahmad) is still nominally the patriarch but Fatima makes the decisions. Be respectful to Ahmad in meetings but direct proposals to Fatima.
- She communicates by WhatsApp more than email. Not ideal from a compliance perspective (Raj has raised this — we need a policy).
- Priya is the RM. Good relationship. But Fatima is demanding — she expects responses within hours, not days.

## Nakamura Family

Called re: adding ¥200M to Asia sleeve. James handling.

That's literally all Thomas left for this family. They have CHF 220M with us. Need to reconstruct relationship notes from Salesforce and James's memory.

## Dietrich Hoffman (PROSPECT — NOT YET CLIENT)

- Met at Baur au Lac dinner (June 2025). Currently with Vontobel. ~CHF 90M.
- Conservative investor. Swiss equities and RE. Old school.
- Does NOT want ESG. Made that very clear. "I invest to make money, not to save the planet." Fine — we can work with that.
- Knows the Van der Berg family socially. DO NOT mention one to the other. Hoffman apparently had a business falling-out with Friedrich years ago. Details unknown but it came up at the dinner and the temperature dropped.
- Thomas was supposed to arrange lunch with Marcus. Never happened (Thomas left). This prospect is going cold.
- If we pursue: approach through Marcus directly. Hoffman responds to seniority.

## RE: conversation with E. — she knows. Handle carefully.

## Gruber Family (FORMER CLIENT — lost to Julius Baer, Sept 2025)

Post-mortem notes (Thomas's draft, never circulated):

Why we lost them:
1. Fee pressure — JB offered 15bps less on the management fee. For CHF 85M, that's ~CHF 127K annual saving.
2. Reporting — Werner Gruber complained about late reports at least 4 times. Never properly resolved.
3. Relationship — Werner's primary RM was Thomas. When Thomas left, no one picked up the baton fast enough. By the time Elena was assigned, JB was already in advanced discussions.
4. Next-gen — their daughter (Hannah, 25) wants digital-first. Our portal wasn't cutting it.

Lessons:
- We cannot let RM transitions be this sloppy
- Price alone didn't lose this — it was the accumulation of service failures
- The CHF 85M is painful but the precedent is worse

*Thomas note: Marcus was furious about this. I don't blame him. We had 12 years with the Grubers. It shouldn't have ended like this.*

## Misc Notes (undated, found in various files)

- **Tanaka family:** Mrs. Tanaka's birthday is March 14. We've sent flowers the last 3 years. CONTINUE THIS.
- **Patel family (prospect):** Aisha Patel emailed Elena in October. Vikram (father) was a client until 2018 — left during the restructuring. Aisha doesn't know the history. Be delicate about why Vikram left. (I don't fully remember either — check archived files from 2017-2018.)
- **Portfolio review season:** Q1 is brutal. Every Platinum client wants their annual review in January or February. We need to stagger better. Last year Thomas, Elena, and James were doing 3 reviews a day for two weeks. Quality suffers.
- **Marcus's pet peeve:** Meeting prep materials that are just data dumps. He wants narrative — "tell me the story of this client's year." Make it human.
- **Sarah's request:** Please, everyone, log your calls in Salesforce on the same day. Not "when I get around to it." Compliance has flagged this twice.

## Internal Politics Notes (Thomas's observations)

*Sarah note: I debated whether to include these. They're unprofessional but some contain useful context. Sharing with ops hire only.*

- Marcus and Raj disagree on risk appetite for AI tools. Marcus wants to move fast; Raj wants bulletproof compliance first. They're both right. The new hire needs to navigate this.
- Elena is the strongest RM we have but she's overloaded. She manages 40% of AUM across 35 families. If she burns out or leaves, we have a serious problem.
- James in London is solid but doesn't always loop in Singapore for APAC-connected clients. Priya has raised this with Sarah (not with James directly). Needs addressing.
- The Singapore team feels like a satellite office, not a true third hub. Priya is handling it gracefully but there's friction. Include them more.
- Thomas's own departure note (never sent): "I built most of the operational infrastructure here from scratch and it's still running on spreadsheets and good intentions. I told Marcus we needed to invest in systems 3 years ago. He agreed in principle but the budget never materialized. I'm tired of being the single point of failure for everything. Good luck to whoever takes this on."
