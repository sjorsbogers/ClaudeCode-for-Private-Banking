## CRITICAL / HIGH PRIORITY ITEMS

---

### 1. [SWITZERLAND] FINMA Circular on AI & Automated Decision-Making in Financial Services
**Published:** 15 December 2025 | **Effective:** 1 July 2026
**Impact for Claudius:** HIGH
**Status:** [ACTION REQUIRED — Deadline: 30 April 2026]

FINMA has issued a new circular (2025/XX — final number pending Federal Gazette publication) establishing supervisory expectations for the use of artificial intelligence and automated decision-making tools by supervised financial institutions.

**Key requirements:**
- All AI tools used in client-facing processes must be documented in an AI register, including: purpose, data inputs, decision scope, human oversight mechanism, and risk classification
- "High-risk" AI applications (those informing investment suitability, client risk profiling, or regulatory reporting) require annual independent review
- Explainability requirement: Firms must be able to explain AI-generated outputs to clients and regulators "in plain language"
- Board-level accountability: A named member of senior management must be designated as responsible for AI governance
- Data used to train or operate AI tools must comply with the existing FINMA circular on operational risks and outsourcing

**Impact assessment for Claudius Capital:**
Project Phoenix tools (client reporting, meeting prep, proposal generation) will fall within scope. We need to:
1. Establish an AI tool register (template being developed by Compliance)
2. Classify each tool by risk level
3. Designate a responsible person (recommendation: Marcus or Sarah)
4. Document human-in-the-loop processes for each tool
5. Ensure all tool outputs include appropriate disclaimers

**Raj's note:** *This is actually good news for us — we're building compliance-first by design. Many competitors will be scrambling. But we need to formalize our approach before the July deadline. I'll be working closely with the Project Phoenix team on this.*

### 2. [UK] FCA Consumer Duty — Enhanced Expectations for Wealth Managers
**Published:** Ongoing (PS23/16 implementation continuing) | **Next review deadline:** 31 July 2026
**Impact for Claudius:** HIGH
**Status:** [ACTION REQUIRED — Deadline: 31 March 2026 internal readiness review]

The FCA has signaled that wealth managers and private banks will face enhanced scrutiny under Consumer Duty in 2026. Key focus areas:

- **Value assessment for advisory fees:** Firms must demonstrate that fees charged are reasonable relative to the service delivered. The FCA has published examples of "poor practice" including: charging premium fees without differentiated service, unclear performance fee calculations, and failure to rebate unused retainer fees.
- **Vulnerable customer identification:** Private banks must have processes to identify and support vulnerable clients, including elderly clients involved in succession planning and clients experiencing bereavement.
- **Communication quality:** Client reports and investment proposals must be "clear, fair, and not misleading" — boilerplate disclosures are not sufficient.

**Impact assessment for Claudius Capital (London office):**
- James Crawford and team must complete a fee value assessment for all UK-booked clients by 31 March
- Our report templates need review — some contain excessive jargon and boilerplate
- The Morrison fee dispute (see separate file) is exactly the kind of case the FCA would scrutinize
- Training session for London team scheduled: 14 February 2026

**Cross-border note:** UK Consumer Duty does not directly apply to Swiss or Singapore operations, but FCA may scrutinize services provided to UK-resident clients regardless of booking center. Li-Na Chen (UK resident, SG-booked) is a relevant example.

### 3. [SINGAPORE] MAS Notice on Cross-Border Marketing and Solicitation
**Published:** 8 January 2026 | **Effective:** 1 April 2026
**Impact for Claudius:** HIGH
**Status:** [ACTION REQUIRED — Deadline: 1 April 2026]

MAS has tightened rules on cross-border marketing to Singapore-based clients by non-Singapore licensed entities. Key changes:

- Zurich and London staff may NOT proactively solicit Singapore-based clients or prospects without prior coordination with the Singapore office
- All investment recommendations to SG-based clients must be documented as originating from the SG-licensed entity
- Marketing materials distributed in Singapore must be approved by the SG compliance function
- Increased reporting requirements for cross-border referral arrangements

**Impact assessment for Claudius Capital:**
- Priya's team must review all active client relationships to confirm proper booking
- Marcus's direct relationships with Chen family and Tanaka family need to be formally documented under the SG entity
- Marketing materials for Singapore Family Office Forum must be reviewed by SG compliance
- Training for all non-SG staff on cross-border solicitation rules: scheduled 28 February 2026

## MEDIUM PRIORITY ITEMS

---

### 4. [EU/SWITZERLAND] EU-Switzerland Equivalence Framework — Financial Services
**Status:** Ongoing negotiations | **Impact:** MEDIUM
**Status:** MONITOR

The EU-Switzerland bilateral framework on financial services equivalence remains under negotiation. Progress has been slow following the collapse of the 2021 framework agreement, but there are indications that a sectoral agreement on financial services could be reached in 2026.

**Implications if agreed:**
- Simplified cross-border access for Swiss firms serving EU clients
- Potential reduction in regulatory duplication for EU/CH dual-domiciled structures
- Positive for Van der Berg family (Dutch/Swiss structure) and other EU-connected clients

**Implications if not agreed:**
- Status quo continues — Swiss firms must rely on individual EU member state third-country regimes
- Potential competitive disadvantage vs. EU-domiciled competitors

**Action:** No immediate action. Compliance will update if material developments occur.

### 5. [ALL] FATF Revisions to Recommendation 16 (Wire Transfer Rules)
**Published:** October 2025 | **National implementation:** Varies (2026-2027)
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Status:** MONITOR — pending national transposition

FATF has revised Recommendation 16 to extend "travel rule" requirements to virtual asset transfers and to enhance originator/beneficiary information requirements for traditional wire transfers above USD/CHF 1,000 (down from USD/CHF 3,000).

**Impact assessment:**
- Operations must update wire transfer screening procedures when national rules are transposed
- Increased data requirements for outgoing transfers — may affect processing times
- Limited direct impact on wealth management clients (most transactions are large and already fully documented)

---

### 6. [SWITZERLAND] Revised Swiss Data Protection Act (revDSG) — Ongoing Compliance
**Effective:** 1 September 2023 (already in force) | **Impact:** MEDIUM
**Status:** [ACTION REQUIRED — overdue items from 2024 review]

Annual compliance review identified several outstanding items from the revDSG implementation:

- **Data processing register:** Mostly complete but missing entries for 3 vendor relationships (Bloomberg, Nexus IT hosting, DocuSign). DEADLINE: 28 February 2026.
- **Privacy notices:** Client-facing privacy notice needs updating to reflect new Singapore data flows. DEADLINE: 31 March 2026.
- **Data breach notification procedure:** Documented but never tested. Tabletop exercise to be scheduled Q1 2026. Responsible: Sarah Chen + IT.
- **Cross-border data transfer assessment:** Pending for transfers to Singapore (need to document adequate safeguards under Art. 16 revDSG). DEADLINE: 28 February 2026.

*Raj's note: These are housekeeping items that should have been completed in 2024. Thomas was tracking them. We need someone to own this going forward.*

---

### 7. [UK] UK-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement — Data Provisions
**Signed:** 2025 | **Status:** Implementation ongoing
**Impact:** MEDIUM (positive)
**Status:** MONITOR

The UK-Singapore DEA includes provisions facilitating cross-border data flows between the UK and Singapore, which may simplify our data transfer compliance for clients with connections to both jurisdictions (e.g., Chen family — Li-Na in London, Wei in Singapore).

No immediate action required but may reduce compliance burden for cross-border data sharing in H2 2026.

### 8. [ALL JURISDICTIONS] AI Governance — Regulatory Landscape Summary
**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH (strategic)
**Status:** MONITOR + preparation

| Jurisdiction | Key Development | Timeline |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Switzerland | FINMA AI circular (see Item 1) | Effective Jul 2026 |
| UK | FCA/PRA joint paper on AI in financial services (consultation expected H1 2026) | Draft expected Q2 2026 |
| Singapore | MAS Fairness, Ethics, Accountability, Transparency (FEAT) principles — voluntary but hardening | Ongoing, revision expected 2026 |
| EU | EU AI Act — phased implementation | High-risk provisions from Aug 2026 |

**Cross-jurisdictional observation:** All three of our operating jurisdictions are moving toward more formal AI governance requirements. Switzerland (FINMA) is moving fastest with binding requirements. The UK approach is likely to be principles-based. Singapore's FEAT framework is voluntary but MAS expects compliance as a practical matter.

**Recommendation:** Build our AI governance framework once, to the highest standard (FINMA), and apply it across all jurisdictions. This is more efficient than three separate frameworks and demonstrates good practice to all regulators.

## LOW PRIORITY / INFORMATIONAL ITEMS

---

### 9. [SWITZERLAND] FINMA Guidance on Sustainable Finance Disclosures
**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM | **Status:** MONITOR

FINMA expects firms offering sustainable/ESG products to ensure client-facing disclosures are accurate and not misleading (anti-greenwashing). Relevant as we formalize ESG offering. Compliance review of any ESG marketing materials before distribution.

### 10. [UK] FCA Overseas Persons Exclusion — Consultation
**Impact:** LOW | **Status:** MONITOR

FCA consulting on potential changes to the overseas persons exclusion that allows non-UK firms to deal with UK-based professional clients. Unlikely to affect our current operating model but worth monitoring.

### 11. [SINGAPORE] MAS Environmental Risk Management Guidelines — Enhanced Expectations
**Impact:** LOW | **Status:** MONITOR

MAS enhancing expectations for climate-related risk disclosure. Primarily affects banks and insurers but wealth managers expected to adopt voluntarily.
