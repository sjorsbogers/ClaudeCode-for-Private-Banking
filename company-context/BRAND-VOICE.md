# Claudius Capital — Brand Voice & Messaging Guidelines

## Core Positioning

**"We combine the personal touch of a boutique with the rigor of an institution."**

Claudius Capital exists in the space between the large private banks — with their process, scale, and impersonality — and the small family offices — with their intimacy, flexibility, and occasional lack of sophistication. We offer both. That positioning must come through in every word we write and every interaction we have.

## Voice Principles

### Professional, Never Stuffy
We are a serious firm managing serious wealth. Our language reflects that gravity. But we are not a 200-year-old Swiss bank clinging to tradition for its own sake. We don't hide behind jargon. We don't use complexity as a signal of intelligence. We explain clearly because we understand deeply.

### Trustworthy, Never Boastful
Trust is earned through consistency, not claims. We let our track record speak. When we do reference performance or capabilities, we do so with precision and context — never with superlatives or unsubstantiated assertions.

### Forward-Thinking, Never Reckless
Our AI-augmented approach is a genuine differentiator. We talk about it with confidence and specificity. But we never position technology as a replacement for human judgment, and we never imply that innovation means we're experimenting with client assets.

### Confident, Never Arrogant
We know what we're good at. We say so directly. But we also acknowledge what we don't know, what we're working on, and where we defer to client preferences. Confidence without humility is arrogance. Arrogance loses clients.

### Technical When Needed, Always Accessible
Some of our clients are former hedge fund managers who want to discuss convexity profiles. Others are business owners who built empires without ever reading a Bloomberg terminal. Our communications must serve both. Lead with clarity. Provide depth for those who want it. Never make a client feel uninformed.

## Writing Examples

### DO / DON'T Comparisons

**Describing investment performance:**

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Your portfolio returned +11.3% in Q3, outperforming the benchmark by 280 basis points. The primary drivers were our overweight in European industrials and the tactical allocation to short-duration credit initiated in July." | "We are pleased to report excellent returns this quarter, significantly beating the market through our superior investment process." |

**Why:** Specificity builds trust. Superlatives ("excellent," "superior") feel like marketing. Clients want to know what happened and why.

---

**Explaining a recommendation:**

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Given the current rate environment and your liquidity needs over the next 18 months, we recommend shifting 15% of your fixed income allocation from long-duration sovereigns to investment-grade corporate bonds with maturities under 3 years. This reduces duration risk while maintaining yield above 4.2%." | "We think bonds are looking interesting right now and suggest making some changes to your portfolio to take advantage of current opportunities." |

**Why:** Vague language signals vague thinking. Clients trust advisors who show their reasoning.

---

**Discussing AI and technology:**

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Our quantitative models flagged an emerging divergence in energy sector valuations last week. Our analysts reviewed the signal, validated it against fundamental data, and identified three specific opportunities that align with your portfolio mandate. We'd like to discuss these in our next meeting." | "Our cutting-edge AI detected a market opportunity that humans would have missed. This is the future of investing." |

**Why:** AI is a tool in our process, not the hero of the story. The human judgment is what clients are paying for.

---

**Responding to a client concern:**

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Thank you for raising this. You're right that the report was delivered later than expected, and I understand the frustration. Here's what happened, what we've done to address it, and what you can expect going forward." | "We apologize for any inconvenience caused. Please rest assured that we take client satisfaction very seriously." |

**Why:** Corporate non-apologies erode trust. Acknowledge specifically, explain honestly, commit concretely.

---

**Introducing the firm to a prospect:**

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "Claudius Capital manages $8.5 billion for over 200 families worldwide. We combine quantitative analysis with fundamental research to build portfolios tailored to each client's specific objectives, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Every client has a dedicated advisor who knows their portfolio — and their priorities — in detail." | "Claudius Capital is a next-generation wealth management firm leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver alpha-generating investment solutions for ultra-high-net-worth individuals and families globally." |

**Why:** The first version tells you what we do and why it matters. The second is a string of buzzwords that says nothing.

## Tone by Context

### Client Reports
Precise, measured, informative. No fluff. Every sentence should either convey data, provide context, or recommend action. Reports are not marketing materials — they are accountability documents.

### Proposals
Confident, structured, client-specific. A proposal should feel like it was written for this client, not pulled from a template with names swapped. Lead with the client's objective, then show how we address it.

### Client Emails
Warm but efficient. Clients are busy. Respect their time. Get to the point, provide what they need, and be clear about next steps. Personal touches are welcome but should be genuine, not formulaic.

### Internal Communications
Direct and honest. Internally, we can be blunter than we are with clients. We value clarity over diplomacy in internal discussions — but we remain respectful. Criticism of ideas is encouraged. Criticism of people is not.

### Marketing & Website
Aspirational but grounded. We can paint a vision, but every claim should be supportable. No "world-class" unless we can prove it. No "unique" unless it's actually true.

## Visual Identity Notes

### Color Palette
- **Navy (#1B2A4A)** — Primary. Authority, depth, trust.
- **Gold (#C4A052)** — Accent. Quality, distinction, warmth.
- **White (#FFFFFF)** — Background. Clarity, space, sophistication.
- **Charcoal (#2D2D2D)** — Body text. Readability, gravitas.
- **Light Grey (#F5F5F5)** — Secondary backgrounds. Softness, structure.

### Typography Guidance
- Headlines: Clean, modern serif (think: confidence without nostalgia)
- Body: Readable sans-serif (think: clarity without coldness)
- Data/tables: Monospace or tabular figures for alignment

### Document Formatting
- Generous white space — never cram a page
- Tables and charts over paragraphs when presenting data
- Every document should have clear hierarchy: title, sections, key takeaways
- Page numbers and dates on every client-facing document
- Claudius Capital logo in header, subtle — not dominating

## The AI Messaging Principle

**"We use AI as a tool, never as a replacement for human judgment."**

This is not just a marketing line. It is a foundational principle that governs how we talk about our approach in every context:

- **To clients:** "Our technology helps us see more, analyze faster, and test more scenarios. Every decision is made by your advisory team, with your specific circumstances in mind."
- **To prospects:** "AI augments our research process and helps us manage risk more precisely. It doesn't make investment decisions — our people do, and they're accountable to you."
- **To regulators:** "All AI-assisted outputs are reviewed and approved by qualified professionals before any client action is taken. We maintain full audit trails of the decision process."
- **Internally:** "Use AI tools to work smarter and serve clients better. Never use them as a shortcut that bypasses the thinking. The tool does the processing; you do the judgment."

When in doubt about how to frame our use of technology, ask: *"Does this make us sound like we're augmenting human expertise, or replacing it?"* If the latter, rewrite.

## Communication Principles for Client-Facing Materials

1. **Lead with what matters to the client.** Not what matters to us. Not what's impressive. What solves their problem or answers their question.

2. **Be specific or be quiet.** Vague reassurances are worse than silence. If you can't provide specifics, say when you will.

3. **One document, one purpose.** A quarterly report is not a marketing opportunity. A proposal is not a compliance exercise. Know what each document is for and stay focused.

4. **Respect the reader's intelligence.** Our clients are successful, accomplished people. Don't over-explain simple concepts. Don't under-explain complex ones. Read the room.

5. **Make the next step obvious.** Every client communication should end with clarity: what happens next, when it happens, and who is responsible.

6. **Proofread like your reputation depends on it.** Because it does. A typo in a client report managing $50M signals carelessness. There is no acceptable error rate for client-facing materials.
