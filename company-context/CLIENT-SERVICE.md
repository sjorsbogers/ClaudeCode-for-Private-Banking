# Claudius Capital — Client Service State

## The Bottleneck in Plain Language

Claudius Capital delivers exceptional investment returns. The portfolio team is world-class. But the experience surrounding those returns — the reporting, the onboarding, the responsiveness, the feeling of being cared for — has been deteriorating for over a year.

Clients aren't leaving because of performance. They're leaving because the experience doesn't match the promise.

## Current Metrics

### Quarterly Reporting
| Metric | Current | Where It Should Be |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Time per client per quarter | ~2 full working days | 0.5 days or less |
| Total quarterly reporting burden | 400+ person-days | 100 person-days |
| Reports delivered on time | 71% | 95%+ |
| Reports requiring manual corrections after delivery | 23% | <5% |

Every quarter, the advisory team essentially stops functioning for three weeks while they compile, review, format, and distribute client reports. Each report is built semi-manually — pulling data from the portfolio system, writing commentary, customizing for the client's specific holdings and preferences, running it past compliance, and formatting it into a PDF.

Thomas had started building templates but never finished. Some advisors use his half-built templates. Others use their own Word documents. Two advisors still use Excel.

### Client Onboarding
| Metric | Current | Industry Benchmark |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Average onboarding time | 3 weeks | 5-7 business days |
| Documents requiring client re-submission | 34% | <10% |
| Onboarding-related compliance flags | 12 in last 6 months | 0 |
| New clients rating onboarding "smooth" | 41% | 80%+ |

Onboarding a new UHNW client at Claudius Capital involves collecting KYC documentation, suitability assessments, investment policy statements, tax documentation across multiple jurisdictions, beneficial ownership declarations, and source-of-wealth verification. The process touches compliance, advisory, operations, and legal.

There is no single onboarding checklist. Each office has developed its own informal process. The Singapore office is actually the most organized (Lisa set it up when she opened it), but Zurich and London operate differently from each other and inconsistently within their own teams.

### Meeting Preparation
| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Prep time per client meeting | 2-3 hours | 30-45 minutes |
| Standardized prep template | None | Yes |
| Pre-meeting briefing docs | Ad hoc, inconsistent | Standardized |
| Meetings where advisor felt "fully prepared" | 58% | 95%+ |

Before every client meeting, relationship managers cobble together a briefing from multiple sources: the portfolio system, CRM notes, previous meeting minutes (if anyone took them), recent market developments relevant to the client's holdings, and any personal notes about the client's preferences, family situation, or concerns.

There's no standard format. No central brief. Senior advisors like Sarah can do this in their sleep because they carry decades of client knowledge in their heads. Junior advisors struggle and occasionally walk into meetings without key context — which clients notice immediately.

### Proposal Generation
| Metric | Current | Competitor Benchmark |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Proposal turnaround | 5-7 business days | 2-3 business days |
| Proposals requiring major revision | 28% | <10% |
| Win rate on proposals | 62% | Was 78% two years ago |

When a prospect or existing client requests a proposal — a new allocation strategy, a private market opportunity, a portfolio restructure — the current process involves the advisor drafting content, the investment team providing data, compliance reviewing for suitability, and someone (usually an analyst) formatting the final document.

The bottleneck isn't any single step. It's the handoffs. Work sits in queues. People forget to pass things along. The advisor assumes compliance has reviewed it; compliance assumes the advisor hasn't sent the final version yet. Five days pass. The client follows up, slightly annoyed.

### Compliance Documentation
| Metric | Current | Required |
|--------|---------|----------|
| KYC files fully up to date | 64% | 100% |
| Suitability records complete | 72% | 100% |
| Regulatory warnings (last audit) | 2 | 0 |
| Time to produce documentation for regulatory request | 3-5 days | Same day |

Raj Patel's compliance team is drowning. With 200+ clients across three jurisdictions (Switzerland, UK, Singapore), the documentation requirements are substantial. Every client needs current KYC, ongoing suitability assessments, transaction documentation, and regulatory reporting.

Thomas was supposed to build a compliance documentation workflow. What he left behind are fragments — a half-populated spreadsheet tracking KYC expiry dates, a draft process document that stops mid-sentence on page 4, and a Notion page titled "Compliance Automation Ideas" with three bullet points and no follow-up.

The two regulatory warnings from the last FINMA audit were for: (1) incomplete source-of-wealth documentation for three clients onboarded in the last 18 months, and (2) inconsistent suitability assessment records where some client files had outdated risk profiles. Neither was a fine, but both were formal warnings with a 6-month remediation deadline. Four months of that deadline remain.

### Client Satisfaction & Retention
| Metric | Current | 12 Months Ago | 24 Months Ago |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Client NPS | 62 | 71 | 78 |
| Annual client churn | 8% | 5% | 3% |
| Clients rating service "excellent" | 34% | 52% | 68% |
| Average response time to client inquiry | 28 hours | 12 hours | 6 hours |

The NPS decline is particularly painful because investment returns have been strong — +14.2% average across client portfolios in the trailing 12 months. Clients are making money. They're just not feeling taken care of.

The churn increase from 3% to 8% represents roughly 10 additional clients lost per year. At an average AUM of $40M per client, that's $400M in assets walking out the door annually — and taking their management fees with them.

## What Clients Are Actually Saying

These quotes are drawn from the annual client satisfaction survey, exit interviews, and notes that Sarah Chen has been collecting from advisory team conversations.

> "The returns are excellent. But I shouldn't have to chase my own advisor for a quarterly report. I have a family office down the street that sends me weekly updates without being asked."
> — **Client, Zurich** (12-year relationship, $85M AUM)

> "When I onboarded, I had to submit my passport scan three separate times because your teams apparently don't talk to each other. For a firm that talks about AI and technology, the experience felt very 2005."
> — **Client, Singapore** (onboarded 8 months ago, $22M AUM)

> "I asked for a proposal on restructuring my fixed income allocation. It took six days. My previous bank would have had something in front of me the next morning. I know you're smaller, but that's supposed to be an advantage, not an excuse."
> — **Client, London** (3-year relationship, $55M AUM)

> "Marcus is brilliant. Sarah is wonderful. But the people around them seem overwhelmed. I don't blame them — I can see the firm is growing fast. I just need to know my affairs are being handled properly."
> — **Client, Zurich** (founding client, $120M AUM)

> "I recommended you to a colleague last year. He told me the onboarding was so painful he almost pulled out before funding his account. I was embarrassed. I haven't made another referral since."
> — **Client, London** (5-year relationship, $38M AUM, historically top referral source)

> "My compliance review meeting felt like a box-ticking exercise. The advisor didn't even have my current portfolio summary in front of him. These meetings are supposed to reassure me that my wealth is in good hands. It had the opposite effect."
> — **Client, Singapore** (2-year relationship, $15M AUM)

## Thomas's Handoff — What He Left Behind

Thomas Reiter worked at Claudius Capital for three years. By all accounts, he understood the problems deeply. His Notion workspace contains genuinely sharp observations about process gaps, client pain points, and operational dependencies. He mapped the quarterly reporting workflow in detail. He identified the onboarding bottlenecks accurately. He even drafted an AI integration roadmap that was ahead of its time.

The problem is that almost none of it was finished. And what was finished wasn't adopted — either because it required buy-in he never secured, or because Marcus overrode standardization for individual client exceptions so many times that the team stopped trying to follow process.

What you'll find in the inherited files:
- Process maps that are 60-70% complete
- Client feedback analyses with real insights buried in rambling documents
- Template drafts that were never finalized or rolled out
- A compliance tracking spreadsheet that hasn't been updated in four months
- Meeting notes from team workshops that generated good ideas but no follow-through
- A genuinely useful competitive analysis of how other firms handle client service

Your job isn't to start from scratch. It's to extract what's valuable, discard what isn't, and actually ship the improvements Thomas could never land.

## The Opportunity

The gap between Claudius Capital's investment quality and its service quality is both the problem and the opportunity. If you can close that gap — even partially — within 90 days, the impact will be measurable:

- **Reduced churn** saves $400M+ in AUM annually (at current rates)
- **Faster onboarding** removes friction from the firm's fastest growth channel (referrals)
- **Standardized reporting** gives back 300+ person-days per year to the advisory team
- **Compliance remediation** removes regulatory risk before the next audit
- **Improved NPS** turns clients back into advocates

The tools exist. The team is willing. What's been missing is someone who can actually make it happen.
