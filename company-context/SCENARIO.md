# Claudius Capital — Company Scenario

## The Firm

Claudius Capital is an AI-driven family office and wealth advisory firm founded 8 years ago by **Marcus Claudius**, a former Managing Director at Goldman Sachs. Marcus left Wall Street with a conviction: that combining quantitative rigor with fundamental investment insight — and layering in modern AI capabilities — could deliver a level of service that traditional private banks couldn't match.

For the first five years, he was right. Claudius Capital built a reputation as the firm where ultra-high-net-worth families got institutional-grade analysis with boutique-level attention. Word spread through referral networks in Zurich, then London, then Singapore. Growth was steady, deliberate, and profitable.

Then it accelerated — faster than the operations could keep up.

## By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Assets Under Management | ~$8.5B |
| AUM Growth | 30% year-over-year |
| Total Clients | 200+ UHNW families |
| Minimum Investable Assets | $10M |
| Employees | 45 (was 25 two years ago) |
| Offices | Zurich (HQ), London, Singapore |
| Average Investment Return (trailing 12mo) | +14.2% |

The investment performance is strong. The client experience is cracking.

## The Investment Approach

Claudius Capital runs a hybrid model that Marcus calls "Augmented Conviction":

- **Quantitative screening** — proprietary models scan global markets for asymmetric opportunities across equities, fixed income, alternatives, and private markets
- **Fundamental deep dives** — a team of analysts validates quantitative signals with traditional research, management meetings, and sector expertise
- **AI-assisted portfolio construction** — machine learning models help optimize allocation, stress-test scenarios, and flag concentration risks
- **Human judgment at every decision point** — no trade, no allocation, no client recommendation goes out without a senior advisor's sign-off

This approach has delivered consistent alpha. The problem was never the investing. The problem is everything around it.

## The Offices & Jurisdictions

### Cross-Border Complexity
Most Claudius Capital clients are not neatly in one jurisdiction:
- A Swiss-domiciled family may have UK property, EU investments, and a Singapore-based trust
- Regulatory compliance must apply the **strictest applicable standard** across all relevant jurisdictions
- Data transfers between offices require appropriate safeguards (Standard Contractual Clauses for EU data, PDPA requirements for Singapore data)
- Reports, proposals, and assessments must include the appropriate regulatory footer for the client's primary jurisdiction

## The People Who Matter

### Marcus Claudius — Founder & Chief Investment Officer
Former Goldman Sachs MD (Rates Trading, then Asset Management). Built Claudius Capital from his own capital and three founding clients. Brilliant investor, impatient operator. Has a habit of saying "we'll figure out the process later" — and later never comes. Deeply loyal to clients. Knows most of them by first name. Increasingly frustrated that service quality is slipping despite hiring more people.

*Marcus's mandate to you:* "I didn't build this firm to have clients waiting five days for a proposal. You have three months. Fix the client service bottleneck, or I'm bringing in McKinsey. And I really don't want to bring in McKinsey."

### Sarah Chen — Head of Client Advisory
Based in London. 15 years at UBS Private Banking before joining Claudius Capital three years ago. Manages relationships with the firm's 40 largest clients personally and oversees the advisory team across all three offices. Extremely polished, deeply knowledgeable, and quietly exhausted. She's the one clients call when they're unhappy, and those calls have been increasing.

*Sarah's take:* "Our clients don't leave because of returns. They leave because we make them feel like a number. And we're starting to make them feel like a number."

### Raj Patel — Head of Compliance
Based in Zurich. Former regulator (FINMA), joined Claudius Capital two years ago when the firm realized it needed proper compliance infrastructure. Methodical, cautious, and increasingly alarmed. The last regulatory audit flagged two areas of concern around KYC documentation and suitability records. Nothing critical yet — but the trajectory worries him.

*Raj's take:* "We're one bad audit away from a serious problem. Thomas was supposed to be building proper documentation workflows. I don't know what he was actually doing."

### Lisa Zimmermann — Chief Operating Officer
Based in Zurich. Joined 18 months ago from Credit Suisse operations. Responsible for technology, operations, and the Singapore office buildout. Pragmatic, direct, and the person most likely to give you an honest answer about what's broken. She hired Thomas. She feels responsible for the gap he left.

*Lisa's take:* "We grew headcount 80% in two years and our processes grew maybe 10%. Every team is doing things their own way. We don't need more people — we need better systems."

## The Broader Team

Beyond the four principals, Claudius Capital has 41 other employees across various roles:

**Investment Team (Zurich)** — 8 people
- 2 Senior Portfolio Managers
- 3 Analysts (including 1 junior hired post-MBA)
- 2 Quantitative Researchers
- 1 Trading Operations Specialist

**Client Advisory (across offices)** — 12 people
- 6 Relationship Managers (2 Zurich, 3 London, 1 Singapore)
- 3 Client Service Associates (administrative support for RMs)
- 2 Business Development associates
- 1 Event & Communications Coordinator

**Operations & Technology** — 7 people
- 3 Operations staff (trade settlement, reporting support, data management)
- 2 IT (infrastructure, systems support)
- 1 Developer (maintains the custom portfolio system — key person risk)
- [1 vacant — Thomas's former position, now yours]

**Compliance & Legal** — 4 people
- 2 Compliance Officers (supporting Raj)
- 1 Legal Counsel (part-time, based in Zurich)
- 1 KYC/AML Analyst

**Finance & Administration** — 5 people
- 1 CFO
- 2 Finance staff (accounting, billing, financial reporting)
- 1 HR Manager
- 1 Office Manager (Zurich)

**Singapore Office** — 6 people (included above in functional counts)
- Growing fastest. Plans to add 4 more staff by end of year.

Most of these 45 people don't have specialized AI tools. They're managing with Excel, Word, email, and SharePoint. The tools you build in this course benefit the RM and analyst roles directly — but the operational improvements cascade to everyone.

## The Situation You've Walked Into

Six weeks ago, **Thomas Reiter** — the Operations Manager — resigned without notice. He'd been at the firm for three years. He was supposed to be the person building scalable client service processes: standardizing reporting, streamlining onboarding, creating systems that could grow with the firm.

What he actually left behind was a mess. Scattered Google Docs. Half-finished process maps. A Notion workspace with 200+ pages of notes that contradict each other. Some of it is genuinely insightful — Thomas understood the problems well. He just never finished solving them.

The rumor is that Thomas left because Marcus kept overriding his process decisions for individual clients ("just make an exception for the Hoffmann family"). Others say he was simply overwhelmed. Either way, the gap he left exposed how fragile the operations really were.

**You are his replacement.** It's your first week. You were hired because of your background in operations and your willingness to learn new tools — specifically, AI-assisted workflows. Lisa pushed for your hire. Marcus approved it with one condition: results in 90 days.

## The 90-Day Mandate

Marcus has given you three months to demonstrate measurable improvement in client service operations. If you can't show progress, he's authorized Lisa to engage a Big 4 consultancy to come in and restructure.

That's not an idle threat. Marcus hates consultants, but he hates losing clients more.

The good news: you have executive support, a motivated (if stretched thin) team, and access to modern tools — including Claude Code — that Thomas never fully leveraged.

The bad news: you have 200+ clients expecting white-glove service, a compliance clock ticking, and a team that's been operating in survival mode for six weeks.

## The Culture

Claudius Capital is ambitious, forward-thinking, and genuinely client-obsessed. People here care. They work late not because they're forced to but because they take personal pride in client outcomes. The Zurich office has a espresso machine that cost more than most cars, and the London team has a tradition of Friday evening whisky tastings in the conference room.

But the culture is also stretched thin. People are burning out. The rapid growth that felt exciting two years ago now feels like running on a treadmill that keeps speeding up. There's a hunger for someone — anyone — to bring order to the chaos without killing what makes the firm special.

That someone is you.
