# Lesson 5.1 — Client Risk Profiler: Setup

## Overview
**Module:** 5 — Shared Add-on
**Phase:** Setup
**Goal:** Scaffold the Client Risk Profiler

---

## Script

### Opening

Every investment recommendation at Claudius Capital must be suitable for the client. Suitability starts with understanding risk tolerance — and right now, that assessment is an inconsistent conversation, not a structured process.

The **Client Risk Profiler** is an interactive assessment that walks a client (or an RM on behalf of a client) through structured questions about investment experience, risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial capacity. It produces a documented risk profile that feeds into suitability decisions.

**Important:** This tool DRAFTS risk profiles. It does not DETERMINE suitability. "AI can DRAFT, not DETERMINE suitability assessments."
