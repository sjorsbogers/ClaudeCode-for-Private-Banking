# Lesson 1.14 — The Compliance Officer's Day

## Role & Context

Role-specific deep-dive. The student steps into Raj's world — regulatory checklists, process audits, policy drafting, and regulatory review preparation. Uses the regulatory-update-bulletin chaos file.

## Script

### Opening

Raj has a regulatory review coming up in 6 weeks. FINMA wants to see documentation of every client-facing process, data handling procedure, and compliance framework. The last review flagged two issues — both related to inconsistent documentation.

Today you prepare the compliance team's materials. No room for gaps. No room for "we'll get to that later." Regulators don't accept "later."

### Exercise 1: Build a Compliance Checklist

<!-- ACTION: Read inherited-chaos/process-docs/regulatory-update-bulletin-q1.md plus general knowledge of MiFID II, GDPR, and FINMA requirements for wealth management.

Create a regulatory compliance checklist:
Requirement | Regulation | Article/Section | Status (Compliant/Gap/Unknown) | Evidence | Priority

Include 12-15 requirements covering:
- Client suitability (MiFID II Art. 25)
- Data protection (GDPR, Swiss DPA)
- KYC/AML procedures
- Best execution
- Record keeping
- Complaint handling
- AI tool governance (if applicable)
- Cross-border data transfers -->

<!-- STOP -->
<!-- USER: Reviews checklist -->

---

### Exercise 2: Audit Existing Processes

<!-- ACTION: Cross-reference the compliance checklist against process documentation chaos files. For each requirement:
- Is there a documented process?
- Does the evidence suggest the process is actually followed?
- What documentation is missing?

Produce an audit findings table:
Requirement | Documented? | Evidence of Compliance | Gaps | Risk Level -->

**Curiosity nudge:** How would Raj react to what we've found? Would he block anything currently in use?

<!-- STOP -->
<!-- USER: Reflects -->

### Exercise 3: Draft a Policy Document

Pick one gap — ideally the most critical — and draft a policy document to close it.

<!-- ACTION: Draft a formal policy document. Could be:
- AI Tool Governance Policy
- Data Retention and Deletion Policy
- Cross-Border Data Transfer Policy

Structure:
1. Purpose and Scope
2. Definitions
3. Policy Statements (specific, actionable)
4. Roles and Responsibilities
5. Procedures
6. Monitoring and Review
7. Applicable Regulations (cite specific articles)
8. Effective Date and Review Cycle

Make it jurisdiction-aware — note where FINMA, FCA, and MAS requirements differ.

<!-- USER: Reviews policy -->

### Exercise 4: Regulatory Review Briefing

Prepare the briefing Raj will use to present the firm's compliance status to his team (and eventually to the regulator).

<!-- ACTION: Create a regulatory review briefing:
1. Overall Assessment (1-2 sentences)
2. Compliant Areas (what's solid, with evidence)
3. Areas of Concern (specific gaps, ranked by severity)
4. Immediate Actions Required (what must happen before the review)
5. Resource Requirements
6. Timeline to Full Compliance
