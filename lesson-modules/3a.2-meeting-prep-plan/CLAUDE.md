# Lesson 3A.2 — Meeting Prep Engine: Plan

## Overview
**Phase:** Requirements
**Goal:** Define what the Meeting Prep Engine should include

---

## Script

### Requirements

What does an RM need before walking into a client meeting?

<!-- ACTION: Use AskUserQuestion:
Q1: "What should the meeting prep include?" (multi-select)
Options: Client Overview (name, AUM, relationship history), Portfolio Snapshot (current allocation, performance), Recent Activity (trades, rebalancing, cash flows), Market Context (relevant market movements), Talking Points (key discussion items, follow-ups from last meeting), Risk Alerts (portfolio drift, concentration, suitability flags), Personal Notes (family updates, preferences, sensitivities)

Q2: "What format works best for meeting prep?"
Options: One-page summary (print and carry), Digital dashboard (tablet-friendly), Both (Recommended) -->

<!-- STOP -->

<!-- ACTION: Create REQUIREMENTS.md for the Meeting Prep Engine based on selections. Include Claudius Capital branding. -->

**Reality Check:** In production, talking points would pull from CRM notes, meeting transcription tools (Fireflies/Otter), and RM notes in SharePoint/Notion. The key challenge is unstructured meeting notes from different RMs in different formats.
