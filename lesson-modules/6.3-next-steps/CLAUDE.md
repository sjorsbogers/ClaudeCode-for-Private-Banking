### Opening

This is the last lesson.

Let's take stock of where you started and where you are now.

### What You've Learned

**Module 0:** You set up your workspace and verified everything works.

**Module 1 — Core Skills:** You learned to navigate, explore, extract, synthesise, analyse, verify, and manage project memory. You consulted advisory boards, navigated disagreements, and built verification into your workflow.

**Module 1 — Role Deep-Dives:** You applied those skills to realistic daily scenarios for your role.

**Module 1 — Advanced:** You learned data classification, prompt engineering, integrations, and systematic verification.

**Build Labs:** You directed the creation of real, deployable tools — from requirements through deployment — without writing a single line of code. You experienced compliance checkpoints and learned that compliance review is a feature, not an obstacle.

**Capstone:** You reviewed your portfolio, designed your personal workflow, and prepared to apply everything to your real work.

### The 70/30 Rule — One Last Time

Claude Code is a powerful tool. It accelerates your work, surfaces insights, and handles complexity. But it doesn't replace your judgment.

**AI does the 70%:** Research, drafting, analysis, formatting, comparison, data extraction.

**You own the 30%:** Verification, context, tone, judgment, accountability.

In regulated finance, that 30% is non-negotiable. Your name goes on the output. Your firm's reputation backs it. Your clients trust it. Own that 30%.

### Resources for Continued Learning

**Claude Code:**
- Official documentation: docs.anthropic.com
- The companion website you used during setup
- Experiment — the best way to learn is to use it daily

**Staying Current:**
- AI governance in financial services is evolving rapidly
- Monitor FINMA, FCA, and MAS guidance on AI tools
- Regulatory sandboxes may open new possibilities

**Building on What You Learned:**
- Create more slash commands for your daily tasks
- Build CLAUDE.md files for different projects
- Share the PM-not-engineer model with colleagues
- Propose AI tool pilots to your leadership (start small, measure results)

### Final Words

You walked into this course as someone who had never used Claude Code. You're leaving as someone who can:

- Explore and analyse complex file systems
- Extract insights from messy, unstructured data
- Synthesise information into professional deliverables
- Consult AI advisory boards and navigate their disagreements
- Build verification workflows for regulated contexts
- Direct the creation of deployable web applications
- Navigate compliance checkpoints with confidence
- Apply all of this to your daily work

That's a significant transformation. Not because of the technology — but because you now know how to direct it effectively. The technology will keep improving. Your ability to direct it is the durable skill.

Marcus gave you 90 days. You delivered.
