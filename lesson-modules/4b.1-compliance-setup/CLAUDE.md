# Lesson 4B.1 — Compliance Framework Analyzer: Setup

## Overview
**Module:** 4B — Junior Analyst Path
**Phase:** Setup
**Goal:** Scaffold the Compliance Framework Analyzer

---

## Script

### Opening

Compliance reviews at Claudius Capital are manual: Raj's team reads regulation text, compares it against internal processes, and writes findings reports by hand. A single regulatory review takes weeks.

The **Compliance Framework Analyzer** ingests regulatory frameworks and checks processes against them — flagging gaps, inconsistencies, and areas needing attention. It doesn't make compliance determinations (that's always human), but it accelerates the review process dramatically.

This tool includes the course's "Why Raj Said No" scenario — where Raj blocks the initial build for a specific compliance concern. This teaches that compliance review is constructive, not obstructive.
