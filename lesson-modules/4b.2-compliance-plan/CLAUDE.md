## Overview
**Phase:** Requirements

---

## Script

### Requirements

Q1: "What should the analyzer check?" (multi-select)
Options: MiFID II suitability requirements, GDPR data handling, KYC/AML procedures, Best execution obligations, Record keeping requirements, Complaint handling, AI tool governance, Cross-border data transfers

Q2: "How should findings be presented?"
Options: Traffic light dashboard (Green/Amber/Red per requirement), Detailed findings report, Both (Recommended) -->

<!-- STOP -->

<!-- ACTION: Create REQUIREMENTS.md. CRITICAL: The tool must be framed as "flags potential gaps for review" NOT "determines compliance." This distinction will be tested in the 4B.3 compliance checkpoint. -->

**Reality Check:** In production: live regulation text feeds, internal policy document management, previous audit findings database, finding tracking system. Key challenge: moving from pattern matching to context-aware compliance analysis.

<!-- STOP -->
