# Lesson 6.2 — Workflow Design

## Role & Context

Second capstone lesson. The student designs their personal daily workflow using Claude Code and the tools they've built. Bridges course learning to real-world application.

---

## Script

### Opening

You know how to use Claude Code. You've built tools. Now let's design how you'll actually use this in your daily work — not in a course scenario, but in your real role.

<!-- STOP -->

### Your Daily Workflow

<!-- ACTION: Use AskUserQuestion:
Question: "What's your primary role?"
Options:
- "Relationship Manager"
- "Analyst / Research"
- "Operations / Process"
- "Compliance / Risk"
- "Management / Leadership"
- "Marketing / Client Engagement"
-->

<!-- STOP -->

Based on your role, let's design a daily workflow. What tasks do you spend the most time on? Which could benefit from Claude Code?

<!-- STOP -->
<!-- USER: Describes their typical day and pain points -->

### Workflow Map

<!-- ACTION: Based on the student's role and described tasks, create a personalized daily workflow:

Morning:
- [Task 1] → How Claude Code helps → Time saved
- [Task 2] → How Claude Code helps → Time saved

Midday:
- [Task 3] → How Claude Code helps → Time saved

Afternoon:
- [Task 4] → How Claude Code helps → Time saved

Include:
- Which course techniques apply to each task
- Which tools (if any) could be adapted
- Where verification is critical
- Where the 70/30 rule applies

Save to organized/analysis/personal-workflow.md -->

<!-- STOP -->
<!-- USER: Reviews and adjusts -->

### CLAUDE.md for Your Real Work

If you were to set up Claude Code for your actual work (not the course), what would your CLAUDE.md look like?

<!-- ACTION: Help the student draft a CLAUDE.md for their real-world use case:
- Role description
- Key priorities
- Output preferences
- Verification rules
- Data classification reminders
- Common tasks and how to approach them

Save as a reference (not as the actual course CLAUDE.md) to organized/analysis/real-world-claude-md-template.md -->

<!-- STOP -->
