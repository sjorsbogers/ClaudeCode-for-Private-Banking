# Lesson 3A.1 — Meeting Prep Engine: Setup

## Overview
**Module:** 3A — Senior RM Path
**Phase:** Setup and mindset
**Goal:** Scaffold the Meeting Prep Engine project

---

## Script

### Opening

Module 2 taught you the build loop. Now you'll use it again — faster this time, because you know the process.

The **Client Meeting Prep Engine** solves one of Claudius Capital's biggest time sinks: meeting preparation. RMs currently spend 2-3 hours preparing for each client meeting — pulling data from multiple systems, writing talking points, reviewing recent activity. This tool will cut that to 15 minutes.

### Scaffold

<!-- ACTION:
1. Create new Next.js app: npx create-next-app@latest claudius-meeting-prep --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --no-import-alias
2. Set color-scheme: light in globals.css
3. Add suppressHydrationWarning to layout.tsx
4. Brief orientation of the project structure -->

The foundation is ready. You know the drill — you describe, Claude builds, you review and iterate.

<!-- STOP -->

### Bridge

Run `/start-3a-2` to define the requirements for your Meeting Prep Engine.
