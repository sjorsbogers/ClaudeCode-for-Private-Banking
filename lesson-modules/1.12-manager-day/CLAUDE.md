## Role & Context

Role-specific deep-dive. The student handles management and leadership tasks — KPIs, dashboards, board materials, risk identification.

## Script

### Opening

Marcus has a board meeting in two weeks. He needs clear, data-driven materials that tell the truth about where Claudius Capital stands operationally. No spin. No vague promises. Specific numbers, honest assessment, actionable recommendations.

Today you're the person preparing those materials. Let's give Marcus what he needs.

### Exercise 1: Extract Performance Metrics

<!-- ACTION: Read across chaos files (process-docs, client-feedback, meeting-notes, client-data) to extract:
- Operational KPIs (report turnaround, onboarding time, proposal turnaround)
- Client metrics (NPS, satisfaction scores, churn rate, AUM growth)
- Team metrics (headcount, client-to-RM ratio, workload indicators)
- Financial metrics (fee revenue, cost per client)

Present as: KPI | Current Value | Source | Trend (improving/declining/flat)
Note which KPIs SHOULD be tracked but aren't -->

<!-- STOP -->
<!-- USER: Reviews metrics -->

Notice the gaps? Some of the most important KPIs aren't being tracked at all. That's a finding in itself.

### Exercise 2: Management Dashboard Summary

<!-- ACTION: Using the board-presentation-q4 chaos file for context on Marcus's presentation style, create a structured management dashboard:
- 4-6 key metrics with traffic light status (Green/Amber/Red)
- Trend arrows (up/down/flat)
- Brief commentary on each metric (1-2 sentences)
- Overall assessment: "Where are we?"

Format it clearly — this should look like something you'd project on a screen -->

**Curiosity nudge:** What would Marcus push back on in this dashboard? What would he want to see differently?

<!-- USER: Reflects -->

### Exercise 3: Board-Ready Executive Summary

Draft a 1-page executive summary. Requirements: specific, actionable, honest.

<!-- ACTION: Draft a board executive summary. Structure:
1. Headline (1 sentence: where the firm stands)
2. Key Achievements (3 bullets — what's working)
3. Critical Challenges (3 bullets — what's not, with specific data)
4. 90-Day Priorities (3 actions with expected outcomes)
5. Resource Asks (what's needed — budget, headcount, technology)

### Exercise 4: Operational Risk Register

<!-- ACTION: Identify top 3 operational risks from the chaos files. For each:
- Risk Description (specific, not vague)
- Likelihood (High/Medium/Low with reasoning)
- Impact (High/Medium/Low with reasoning)
- Evidence (which chaos files support this)
- Mitigation Recommendation (specific action)
- Owner (who at Claudius Capital should own this)
