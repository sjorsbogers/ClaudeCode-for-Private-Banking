# Lesson 6.1 — Portfolio Review

## Role & Context

First capstone lesson. The student reviews everything they've built and produced across the entire course. This is reflective, not instructional.

---

## Script

### Opening

You've completed the Build Labs. Before we wrap up, let's step back and look at the full picture — everything you've built, learned, and produced.

Think of this as a portfolio review with Marcus. He gave you 90 days. Let's show him what you've accomplished.

<!-- STOP -->
<!-- USER: Ready for review -->

---

### Tool Portfolio

<!-- ACTION: List all tools the student built (based on which modules they completed):
- Tool name, module, purpose, deployment URL (if deployed)
- For each tool: what it does, what problem it solves, estimated ROI

Present as a clean portfolio summary -->

<!-- STOP -->
<!-- USER: Reviews portfolio -->

---

### Analysis Portfolio

<!-- ACTION: List all analysis deliverables saved to organized/ during Module 1:
- File name, lesson it was produced in, what it contains
- Assess: how well-organized is the student's organized/ folder?
- Note any missing deliverables that should have been saved -->

<!-- STOP -->

---

### Improvement Opportunities

For each tool, what would you improve? Not new features — but quality improvements to what exists.

<!-- ACTION: For each built tool, suggest 2-3 specific improvements based on what the student learned in later lessons. For example:
- Report Generator: add the verification workflow from 1.18
- Meeting Prep: integrate the prompt templates from 1.16
- All tools: apply the data classification awareness from 1.15 -->

<!-- STOP -->
<!-- USER: Discusses improvements they'd prioritize -->

---

### The Marcus Presentation

Let's draft a 1-page summary for Marcus — "Here's what I've accomplished in my first 90 days."

<!-- ACTION: Create a presentation-ready summary:
1. Tools built (with deployment links)
2. Analysis completed (key findings)
3. Processes documented or improved
4. ROI summary (total time/cost savings)
5. Recommended next steps

Save to organized/leadership-updates/90-day-summary.md -->
