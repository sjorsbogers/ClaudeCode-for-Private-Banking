**Goal:** Define the IC memo structure and input format

## Script

### Requirements

What goes into an Investment Committee memo?

<!-- ACTION: Use AskUserQuestion:
Q1: "Which sections should the IC memo include?" (multi-select)
Options: Fund Overview (strategy, AUM, team), Performance Analysis (returns, benchmarks, attribution), Risk Assessment (key risks, stress scenarios), Operational Due Diligence (infrastructure, compliance, governance), Fee Analysis (management fee, performance fee, waterfall), Investment Thesis (why invest, edge, conviction level), Key Concerns (red flags, open questions), Recommendation (invest/pass/monitor with rationale)

Q2: "How should data be input?"
Options: Paste raw notes (free text), Structured form fields, Upload DDQ document, All methods (Recommended) -->

<!-- STOP -->

<!-- ACTION: Create REQUIREMENTS.md. Include IC memo template structure. -->

**Reality Check:** In production, this would connect to fund databases (PitchBook, Preqin), regulatory filings (SEC, FCA), and internal DD files. The key challenge is verifying fund-reported data against independent sources.
