# Lesson 5.4 — Client Risk Profiler: Ship It

## Overview
**Phase:** GitHub + Deploy (merged)

---

## Script

Last tool. Let's ship it.

<!-- ACTION:
1. git init, .gitignore, add, commit
2. gh repo create --private --source=. --push
3. Verify private
4. npx next build (pre-deploy check — catch type errors)
5. npx vercel --prod
6. Update GitHub description with live URL
7. Verify private -->

<!-- STOP -->

### Build Lab Journey: Complete

Look at what you've built:

| Tool | Module | Time Saved |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Client Report Generator | 2 | 350+ person-days/year |
| Meeting Prep Engine OR Memo Builder | 3A/3B | 450 hours/year |
| Proposal Generator OR Compliance Analyzer | 4A/4B | Significant |
| Client Risk Profiler | 5 | Standardized assessments |

Every tool was built using the same loop: describe → build → review → iterate → compliance check → ship. You directed the entire process as product manager.

### What's Next
