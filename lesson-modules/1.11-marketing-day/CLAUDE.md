## Role & Context

Role-specific deep-dive. The student handles marketing and client engagement tasks for Claudius Capital — events, content, client matching.

## Script

### Opening

Claudius Capital's investment performance is strong, but client engagement is slipping. Today you step into the marketing lead's role: how do you deepen relationships through events, thought leadership, and personalised outreach?

The challenge: 200+ UHNW families, three offices, diverse interests. One-size-fits-all marketing won't work. These clients expect exclusivity and relevance.

### Exercise 1: Event Research

<!-- ACTION: Read inherited-chaos/competitor-research/marketing-events-calendar.md. Extract and expand:
- Upcoming industry events relevant to UHNW clients
- Categorise by type: finance conferences, art/culture, philanthropy, family office forums
- Note which events competitors are sponsoring
- Identify 3-4 events where Claudius Capital should have a presence

### Exercise 2: Client-Event Matching

Not every client cares about every event. Let's match clients to events based on what we know about them.

<!-- ACTION: Using client data chaos files and the event research, create a client-event matching matrix:
- Client/Family | Known Interests | Recommended Events | Reasoning
- Include 5-6 client families
- Reference specific chaos file details for interest mapping -->

**Curiosity nudge:** How does your firm decide which clients to invite to which events? Is it systematic or ad hoc?

<!-- STOP -->
<!-- USER: Reflects -->

### Exercise 3: Personalised Invitation

Draft an event invitation for a specific client family. It should feel personal — like it comes from someone who knows them — not mass-produced.

<!-- ACTION: Draft an invitation for the Van der Berg family (or similar prominent client). Requirements:
- Reference something specific to their situation
- Tone: exclusive and warm, not salesy
- Include logistics without making it feel like a form letter
- 150-200 words maximum -->

<!-- USER: Reviews invitation -->

### Exercise 4: Content Calendar

Create a quarterly content calendar — 8-12 content pieces across different formats and topics.

<!-- ACTION: Create a content calendar table:
Week | Topic | Format | Target Audience | Distribution Channel | Owner
Include mix of: market commentary, thought leadership, client stories, regulatory updates, event recaps
Save to organized/analysis/content-calendar-q1.md -->
