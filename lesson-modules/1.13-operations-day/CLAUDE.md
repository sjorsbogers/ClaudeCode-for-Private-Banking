# Lesson 1.13 — The Operations Lead's Day

## Role & Context

Role-specific deep-dive. The student steps into Lisa's world — process mapping, gap analysis, data quality, process improvement proposals.

## Script

### Opening

Lisa Zimmermann has a saying: "If you can't document the process, you don't have a process — you have folklore."

Thomas left behind an operations manual. The problem? It describes what SHOULD happen. The chaos files show what ACTUALLY happens. Your job today: find the gaps between the documented process and reality, and propose how to fix the biggest bottleneck.

### Exercise 1: Map the Actual Onboarding Process

<!-- ACTION: Read inherited-chaos/process-docs/operations-manual-2023.md (what should happen) and cross-reference with client feedback, meeting notes, and correspondence (what actually happens).

Map the onboarding process as it ACTUALLY works:
Step # | Activity | Owner | Time Estimate | Documentation | Notes/Issues

Identify:
- Steps in the manual that don't happen in practice
- Steps that happen but aren't in the manual
- Handoff points where things fall through cracks -->

<!-- STOP -->
<!-- USER: Reviews the process map -->

The gap between documentation and reality is where problems hide. Every undocumented step is a point of failure when someone leaves — which is exactly what happened with Thomas.

### Exercise 2: Gap Analysis

<!-- ACTION: Create a formal gap analysis comparing the operations manual against the evidence:

Gap # | Manual Says | Reality Shows | Evidence Source | Impact | Priority
Include 6-8 specific gaps with evidence from chaos files -->

**Curiosity nudge:** Which gap would you fix first, and why? Think about the 90-day deadline.

<!-- STOP -->
<!-- USER: Reflects and chooses -->

### Exercise 3: Data Quality Assessment

Operations live and die by data quality. Let's audit what we're working with.

<!-- ACTION: Examine client data chaos files. Produce a data quality report:
- Field completeness (which fields are consistently filled vs. sparse)
- Format consistency (dates, currencies, naming conventions)
- Duplication (same information stored differently in different files)
- Staleness (how old is the data? when was it last updated?)
- Specific issues found (with examples)

<!-- STOP -->
<!-- USER: Reviews data quality report -->

### Exercise 4: Process Improvement Proposal

Pick the single biggest bottleneck and draft a proposal to fix it.

<!-- ACTION: Create a process improvement proposal. Structure:
1. Problem Statement (specific, with evidence and metrics)
2. Current State (how it works now, how long it takes, what goes wrong)
3. Proposed State (how it should work, expected time, key changes)
4. Implementation Steps (5-7 specific actions)
5. Expected Impact (time saved, error reduction, client satisfaction)
6. Risks (what could go wrong with the change)
7. Resource Requirements (people, tools, time)
8. Success Metrics (how you'll know it worked)

### Wrap-Up

| Skill | What You Did |
|-------|-------------|
| **Process mapping** | Documented how onboarding actually works vs. manual |
| **Gap analysis** | Identified specific discrepancies with evidence |
| **Data quality** | Audited data completeness, consistency, and freshness |
| **Improvement proposal** | Drafted a structured proposal for the biggest bottleneck |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Actual onboarding process mapped with evidence
- [ ] Gap analysis with 6+ specific gaps
- [ ] Data quality report saved to organized/analysis/
