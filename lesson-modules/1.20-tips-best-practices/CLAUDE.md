## Script

### Opening

You've completed Module 1. Before you move to the Build Labs — or back to your daily work — let's consolidate the best practices and efficiency tips that will make you faster and more effective.

Think of this as the "cheat sheet" lesson.

### Efficiency Tips

**Conversation management:**
- Start fresh conversations for distinct tasks (don't let one conversation become a kitchen sink)
- Use CLAUDE.md to carry context between sessions
- Save deliverables to files, not just conversation

**Working with files:**
- Describe what you want in plain English — you don't need exact file paths
- When Claude misidentifies a file, point it to the right one by name
- Use the `organized/` folder pattern: analysis, leadership-updates, client-reports, tools

**Getting better output:**
- Be specific: "Draft a 1-page executive summary" beats "write something about this"
- Use the RCTFC framework from Lesson 1.16 (Role, Context, Task, Format, Constraints)
- When output is mediocre, don't regenerate — give targeted feedback and iterate
- Use the critique-and-improve pattern from Lesson 1.3a

**Keyboard shortcuts (IDE):**
- Open terminal: Ctrl+` (US) / Ctrl+Shift+` (EU keyboards)
- Zoom in/out: Ctrl/Cmd + / Ctrl/Cmd -
- Toggle sidebar: Ctrl/Cmd + B
- New terminal tab: Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + `

### The 70/30 Rule

This is the most important mental model for AI-assisted work:

**AI gets you 70% of the way. Your judgment is the critical last 30%.**

That last 30% includes:
- **Verification** — Is this accurate? Do the sources check out?
- **Context** — Does this make sense given what I know about the situation?
- **Tone** — Is this appropriate for the audience?
- **Judgment** — Should we do this at all? Is it the right approach?
- **Accountability** — My name goes on this. Am I comfortable with it?

In regulated industries, that 30% is non-negotiable. The AI doesn't have a licence. You do. The AI doesn't have a fiduciary duty. You do. The AI doesn't face regulatory consequences. You do.

Use AI for the 70% — the research, the drafting, the analysis, the formatting, the comparison. Own the 30% — the decisions, the verification, the professional judgment.

### Exercise 1: Portfolio Review

Let's review everything you've produced in Module 1. How organised is your work?

<!-- ACTION: List the contents of the organized/ folder and any other deliverables created during Module 1. Present a summary:
- How many deliverables were produced
- How well-organised they are
- Any files that should be renamed or reorganised
- Any exercises whose output was left in conversation and should be saved -->

<!-- STOP -->
<!-- USER: Reviews their portfolio -->

### Exercise 2: Personal Workflow Guide

Create your own best practices document — a guide for future you. What worked? What would you do differently?

<!-- ACTION: Help the student create a personal workflow guide. Prompt them for:
- Their preferred working style (detailed instructions vs. broad direction?)
- Best practices they want to remember
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Their favourite techniques from Module 1

Save to project root as my-workflow-guide.md -->

### Module 1 Complete

You've finished all 20 lessons of Module 1. Here's your skill map:

**Core Skills (1.1-1.8):** File exploration, extraction, synthesis, source attribution, commands, parallel processing, sub-agents, project memory, verification

**Role Deep-Dives (1.9-1.14):** RM workflows, analyst workflows, marketing, management, operations, compliance

**Advanced Techniques (1.15-1.18):** Data classification, prompt engineering, integrations, systematic verification

**Reference (1.19-1.20):** Troubleshooting, best practices

### What's Next

**Build Labs (Modules 2-5):** Direct the creation of real, deployable tools.
- Start with Module 2 (Client Report Generator) — run `/start-2-1`
- After Module 2, choose your path: RM (3A, 4A) or Analyst (3B, 4B)

**Capstone (Module 6):** Review your tool portfolio and design your personal workflow.

Or — take what you've learned and apply it to your real work today. Module 1 gives you everything you need to use Claude Code productively. The Build Labs are optional advanced modules for those who want to experience directing full tool builds.

## Important Notes for Claude

- This is a wrap-up lesson — be celebratory but not over-the-top
- The portfolio review should be honest about what was and wasn't produced
- The workflow guide should be genuinely personal, not generic
- Make the path choice feel empowering

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Student reviewed efficiency tips
- [ ] 70/30 rule understood and acknowledged
- [ ] Portfolio of Module 1 deliverables reviewed
- [ ] Personal workflow guide saved to project root
- [ ] Student chose their next path
