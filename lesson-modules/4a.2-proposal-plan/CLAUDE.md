**Phase:** Requirements

## Script

### Requirements

<!-- ACTION: Use AskUserQuestion:
Q1: "What should the proposal include?" (multi-select)
Options: Firm Overview (Claudius Capital story, AUM, approach), Investment Philosophy (quant+fundamental+AI approach), Track Record (performance data with required disclaimers), Team (key personnel, credentials), Service Model (what the client gets), Fee Structure (management fee, performance fee, minimums), Regulatory Disclosures (jurisdiction-specific), Why Claudius Capital (competitive differentiators)

Q2: "Should the proposal adapt to jurisdiction?"
Options: Single format for all, Jurisdiction-aware (different disclosures for CH/UK/SG) (Recommended) -->

<!-- STOP -->

<!-- ACTION: Create REQUIREMENTS.md with multi-jurisdiction awareness. Note: proposals must include past-performance disclaimers ("Past performance is not indicative of future results") and jurisdiction-specific regulatory disclosures. -->

**Reality Check:** In production: CRM for prospect pipeline, portfolio system for track record, compliance system for current disclosures, template management with approval workflow. Key challenge: keeping regulatory disclosures current across three jurisdictions.
